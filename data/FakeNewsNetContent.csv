Trump to Jimmy Fallon: 'Be a man.' Late-night host answers with donation to help migrants.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-jimmy-fallon-be-man-over-hair-tussling-episode-n886221,www.nbcnews.com,20,1,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is telling ""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon to ""be a man"" and stop ""whimpering"" about the personal anguish he felt over the backlash he received after messing up Trump's hair during a 2016 campaign appearance on the late-night talk show.

Fallon recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he ""made a mistake"" on the Sept. 15, 2016, episode and would do it differently.

During that interview with the presidential candidate, Fallon thanked Trump ""for giving us the material that we are doing"" and said he has been ""amazing to follow"" because ""you say some shocking things that I cannot even believe.""

""But I'm trying not to anyway,"" Trump replied.

Fallon's latest comments, however, didn’t appear to sit well with Trump.

The president tweeted Sunday:

.@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous “hair show” with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have “humanized” me-he is taking heat. He called & said “monster ratings.” Be a man Jimmy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

Fallon responded on Twitter with a nod to the plight of young immigrants caught up in administration policies.

""In honor of the President’s tweet I’ll be making a donation to RAICES in his name,"" Fallon said, referring to a nonprofit organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrant children, families and refugees in Texas.

In honor of the President’s tweet I’ll be making a donation to RAICES in his name. — jimmy fallon (@jimmyfallon) June 25, 2018

The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, is the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas. The organization is on the front lines of the immigration battle in Texas."

How to get Meghan Markle-worthy lips in 3 easy steps,https://www.redonline.co.uk/beauty/10-best/a23580879/meghan-markle-nude-lipstick-how-to/,www.redonline.co.uk,74,1,"Meghan Markle has inspired many a trend since officially entering the royal family in May. Even before she'd been given her new title of Duchess of Sussex, her polished sense of style was lauded world over and her every move copied and analysed by fashion and beauty experts.

No more so than her hair, nail colour, love of boat-neck dresses and, most importantly, her lip colour... (seen her in her engagement photo with Prince Harry)

Usually the season where red lipsticks are tentatively worn alongside our winter wardrobes, thanks to 'the Meghan-effect', nude lipsticks are higher than ever on our winter wish-lists, and being favoured over their red predecessor.

What to Read Next

We've hunted down her reported exact lipstick in the hopes of looking a little more regal this Christmas, and provided some basic tips on how to perfect your pout to rival the Duchess:

Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution lipstick in Very Victoria, £24

Reported to be Markle's favourite lipstick; we love the dark blush 3D tones, and the fact that the lipstick glides on seamlessly thanks to orchid and lipstick tree extracts, slicks on with a matte finish and never looks dry on the lips thanks to a blend of oils and waxes.



Previously out of stock (unsurprisingly), Charlotte Tilbury have obviously wised up and now seems to be kept in regular stock online.

3 steps to Duchess-worthy lips:



1. Prime

Your lips will never look like Meghan's if you just splash some lipstick onto chapped, winter lips, and slathering them with heavy lip balm first will just cause the colour to wear off immediately (an absolute disaster if you have a day of royal engagements ahead of you, which obviously we do), so priming the blank canvas first is a must, just as we would our skin.

First, exfoliate lips gently with a lip scrub, then apply a deeply moisturising lip mask (leave on for 5 minutes, then wipe away any excess)



2. Apply lipstick

Now that you have the perfect base, apply lip stick with a lip brush (to get into every crevice and limit the risk of it wearing off throughout the day) evenly over the whole lip area and pay close attention to the edges - a true Duchess would never be caught dead with bleeding or smudged lipstick



3. Set

Now that the colour is on perfectly, you want itstay on, all that air-kissing and smiling is bound to take it's toll. Blot lips with a single sheet of tissue paper and gently dust loose powder on top of the sheet. For a more natural, dewy finish - spritz lips with a makeup setting spray, just as you would the rest of your face."
"James Van Der Beek Reveals He's Been Sexually Harassed By 'Older, Powerful Men'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-van-der-beek-sexual-harassment_us_59df1a83e4b0eb18af063d84,www.huffingtonpost.com,74,1,"LOADING ERROR LOADING

The wave of women coming forward accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault has prompted some men to speak out with their own stories of sexual misconduct in Hollywood.

In a series of tweets, “Dawson’s Creek” star James Van Der Beek said that he “had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men.”

“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star Terry Crews shared a similar story on Tuesday, recounting when a “high level” executive “groped my privates.” He said he didn’t speak out at the time for fear of losing job opportunities.

The actors’ allegations follow damning reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker detailing decades of Weinstein’s alleged misconduct. More than a dozen women have come forward, including three who have accused him of rape. The now-disgraced Hollywood titan has received widespread condemnation, including from former President Barack Obama. On Sunday, Weinstein was fired from his namesake company."

Judge denies Rose McGowan’s motion to dismiss felony cocaine possession charge,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/12/judge-denies-rose-mcgowans-motion-to-dismiss-felony-cocaine-possession-charge/,www.mercurynews.com,31,1,"Rose McGowan’s legal team has argued that Harvey Weinstein was responsible for planting drugs in the actresses’ wallet. A Virginia judge wasn’t convinced it was enough to drop the felony cocaine possession charge against the “Charmed” actress.

Judge Deborah Welsh of Loudoun County General District Court on Monday denied McGowan’s motion to dismiss the case from January 2017, when an airplane cleaning crew found McGowan’s wallet next to the seat she had occupied for a flight to Dulles International Airport. The wallet allegedly contained two bags that tested positive for cocaine.

McGowan’s lawyer filed paperwork in February claiming Weinstein might have set up the actress.

“It is now public knowledge that Weinstein employed underhanded tactics to ‘silence’ his victims,” Jessica Carmichael said in court documents, according to the People. It has been reported that Weinstein hired intelligence agencies to spy on his accusers.

Carmichael also said five hours elapsed from when her client deplaned to the time that her wallet discovered.

“There is simply no point in time at which the evidence places Ms. McGowan and the cocaine together in the same place,” she wrote, according to the Daily News.

Judge Welsh said it would be premature to dismiss charges against McGowan prior to her March 21 preliminary date. Prosecutors have also said they have additional evidence that were not included in the original charges filed against McGowan.

McGowan herself floated the idea that Weinstein was retaliating against her for her naming him as her alleged rapist.

Sarah Stage Steps on the Scale 2 Weeks After Giving Birth to Reveal Her Post-Pregnancy Weight,https://people.com/bodies/sarah-stage-shows-off-weight-two-weeks-after-giving-birth/,people.com,56,1,"She became known as the “six-pack mom” for her ability to keep her toned abs during her two pregnancies. And on Thursday, lingerie model Sarah Stage showed off her post-pregnancy weight just two weeks after the birth to her second child.

The 33-year-old social media star stepped on the scale in a photo for her Instagram Story captured by E!, showing that she was down to 124.8 pounds. “Going to keep on sticking to my nutrition guide,” she wrote on the picture.

It was the first time Stage had weighed herself since in the arrival of son Logan Alexander, who was born via c-section on Oct. 16. He weighed-in at 7 lbs. and 2 oz., and was 19 inches long.

While Stage didn’t reveal the final amount of weight she had ultimately gained during her pregnancy, she had previously shared in August (when she was 8 months pregnant) that she had only gained 18 pounds.

Stage said Friday that her followers had been asking her on social media about her post-pregnancy weight loss, E! reported.

The mother of two, who shares Logan Alexander and 2 ½-year-old big brother James Hunter with husband Kris Jason, has faced criticism for her small belly during both pregnancies.

“Since I’ve announced my second pregnancy, I’ve had certain ‘Instagram medical experts’ tell me what I should and shouldn’t do,” she wrote in a September post while taking on the critics. “And while I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OB/GYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don’t do it! I always do what’s best for my growing baby and put him first!”

“It’s a proven medical fact that continuing exercising while pregnant has many health benefits for you and baby,” she added. “There are also some people who assume that since I am exercising while pregnant, that I’m obsessed with how I ‘look’ but in fact I’m obsessed with maintaining a healthy lifestyle that will give my baby and myself the best possible quality of life.”

As she continues to recover from her c-section, Stage is resting at home with her family.

“Enjoying this newborn phase,” she wrote on Instagram Oct. 30. “It’s true what everyone says that it goes by so fast. It’s been nice resting, healing and cuddling with the babes. Still recovering from c section and continuing to take it easy at home. My goal is to make it all the way through trick or treating tomorrow with the family #csectionrecovery #2weeksold #momlife #2under3Club.”

She stayed true to her promise, dressing up the next day as Star Wars characters for the big day."

"'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money",https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6,www.businessinsider.com,60,1,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

A Wall Street analyst told THR that ""Solo"" will lose more than $50 million, while other industry financing sources told the outlet that the film's loss could exceed $80 million.

""Solo"" dropped 65% at the box office in its second weekend, and it is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.

The box-office struggles of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" could result in a loss of at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

""Solo"" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated $250 million production budget and marketing costs that likely doubled its total budget.

B. Riley FBR senior analyst Barton Crockett told THR that ""Solo"" will lose more than $50 million, while other industry financing sources told the outlet that the loss could exceed $80 million, depending on auxiliary revenues and the undisclosed, exact terms of Disney's deal for the film.

""Solo"" dropped 65% at the box office in its second weekend of release, and its global box office total currently stands at $264.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.

""Solo"" also bombed in its opening weekend in China, as Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio reported. The film brought in only $10.1 million over Memorial Day weekend in China, a record low for ""Star Wars"" films in the country, though the franchise itself has historically never grabbed the attention of China, the world's second-largest movie market.

If it doesn't see a late surge, as analysts are predicting it won't, ""Solo"" will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money.

2017's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" brought in $1.332 billion at the global box office, while the first ""Star Wars"" spin-off ""Rogue One"" grossed $1.056 billion in 2016.

The first collaboration from Disney and Lucasfilm, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" grossed $2.068 billion in 2015, setting off a renewal of the ""Star Wars"" series that is now likely to see its first miss in ""Solo."""

Miss USA Kara McCullough criticised for saying healthcare a 'privilege',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39922784,www.bbc.com,51,1,"The new Miss USA beauty pageant winner has sparked controversy by declaring that healthcare was a ""privilege"", not a right.

Kara McCullough, a scientist at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, appeared to link healthcare to employment.

But the beauty queen, 25, faced a backlash on social media.

It comes as the Trump administration battles to overturn Obamacare, which aimed to extend insurance coverage to the 15% of Americans who lack it.

Earlier this month the lower chamber of the US Congress passed a new healthcare act that Democrats say will leave millions uninsured.

However, Republicans in the Senate have indicated they will cast it aside and write a new law."

Ed Sheeran thinks his ""Game of Thrones"" character is still somewhere in Westeros but shouldn't be.

The 27-year-old musician spoke with BuzzFeed and talked about his controversial cameo on the hit HBO show's seventh season and said he thinks his character should have met his end.

Sheeran's cameo as a singing Lannister soldier that Arya meets in the woods was met with some backlash from fans of the series. The singer left Twitter shortly after the hate and addressed his appearance on Instagram.

""I came off Twitter Coz [sic] I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my 'Game of Thrones' cameo, because I am in 'Game of Thrones,' why the here would I worry what people thought about that,"" he wrote. ""It's clearly f---in' awesome.""

Tom Hanks Jokes About 'High Maintenance' Meryl Streep: 'You're Expecting French Horns',https://people.com/movies/tom-hanks-jokes-working-high-maintenance-meryl-streep/,people.com,17,1,"Even when Tom Hanks tries to throw a few jabs at Meryl Streep, he can’t keep up the charade for long.

During an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to promote their movie The Post, Hanks playfully joked about what it’s like to work with his costar.

When the host brought up Streep, the veteran actor rolled his eyes and said, “You mean, can I just say, ‘high maintenance Meryl Streep?’ ” Hanks replied.

Wanting more, Colbert asked, “Oh really? Diva?”

“Look, the shoes alone, man,” Hanks joked, quickly adding, “No, I am so joking.”

Turns out, the Oscar-winning actress doesn’t get any special treatment.

“You know what’s scary about Meryl? She comes in and does it just like everybody else does,” Hanks explained. “You’re expecting French horns before she enters the stage.”

Putting on a voice, he continued, “You expect a guy in livery to come out: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, the actress known as Meryl Streep.’ And she comes in and waves to the crew the way the royals used to.”

However, Streep was thrown for a loop by Steven Spielberg’s directing style.

“She was mad at me because I didn’t tell her Steven doesn’t rehearse. He just wants to figure it out as he goes along. He’s almost like a guerrilla filmmaker,” Hanks shared. “He has the set, he has the space and he wants to fill it with something he hasn’t imagined before. I don’t mean to [say] that he’s not prepared — he’s the most prepared man in the world.”

Spielberg takes a look back to the summer of 1971 when President Richard Nixon shattered norms by taking action to silence the media.

Thousands of pages of secret documents about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, documenting from the end of World War II until 1967, were leaked to The New York Times, which began publishing them in a series that became known as the Pentagon Papers. Nixon responded to the leak by securing a court order that barred the newspaper from publishing after only a handful of stories were printed.

That’s where Spielberg’s film picks up as The Washington Post, headed by publisher Katherine Graham (Streep) and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), must grapple with whether to begin publishing the reports themselves — at the risk of garnering the same swift shut down, or worse, if the Nixon administration decided to make an example of them.

Farrah Abraham,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrah_Abraham,en.wikipedia.org,12,1,"American reality TV personality (born 1991)

Farrah Abraham (born May 31, 1991) is an American reality television personality, singer, pornographic actress, and writer. Born and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa, she received public attention after being cast in the reality television series 16 and Pregnant in 2009, which documented the pregnancies and first months of motherhood for several young women. Later that year, she was cast in the spin-off series Teen Mom, and appeared in each of its four seasons until its conclusion in 2012. That August, she released her debut studio album and first memoir, both of which were titled My Teenage Dream Ended. The book made it onto The New York Times bestseller list.[4]

Early life

Farrah Abraham was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa.[3] Her father, Michael Abraham, is of Syrian and Italian descent. Her mother, Debra Danielsen, is of Danish and Sicilian ancestry.[5][6][7] She grew up with her half-sister, Ashley Danielsen. Her parents divorced in 2010 and in 2017, her mother married David Merz.[8]

Career

16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom

In 2008, Abraham, then 17, was selected to appear on the MTV show, 16 and Pregnant, a reality series that aimed to document the lives of pregnant teenagers across the United States.[9][2] News of her pregnancy caused issues between her and her mother, Debra Danielsen, with Danielsen calling her daughter a whore and preventing her from obtaining an abortion; being pregnant, Abraham was forced to discontinue her cheerleading.[10][9] Furthermore, during filming, Derek Underwood, the father of her child, died in a car accident.[11] Abraham gave birth to the couple's daughter, Sophia Laurent Abraham, on February 23, 2009.[12][13] Abraham's episode of 16 and Pregnant aired on June 17, 2009.

Later that year she was cast in the spin-off series Teen Mom; it followed Abraham, in addition to Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell and Amber Portwood, who also appeared on episodes of 16 and Pregnant, during their first years of motherhood.[14] The series premiere was broadcast on December 8, 2009.[15] Abraham and her mother are seen to have a rocky relationship throughout Teen Mom, with Danielsen being charged with assault in an Iowa court for hitting her in January 2010.[16] Abraham started seeing a therapist to discuss the rocky relationship with her family, because she couldn't cope with her mother's actions as well as dealing with her emotions regarding Sophia's father, Derek Underwood and his death. Farrah eventually proved to Derek's family through a paternity test that Derek was in fact Sophia's father and then was faced with a lawsuit filed by Derek's mother for grandparents' visitation rights, despite no previous contact with Sophia.

In 2011, she began attending the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in Florida, where she got an associate degree in culinary arts and management. She later launched the ""Mom & Me"" pasta sauce line.[17]

On August 1, 2012, Abraham ventured into the music industry with the release of her debut studio album My Teenage Dream Ended.[18] It received overwhelmingly negative reviews from contemporary music critics, but has since been reappraised as avant-garde outsider art.[19][20] Abraham released a memoir by the same title on August 14.[21] After airing four seasons, the series finale of Teen Mom aired on August 29, 2012.[22]

In 2013, Abraham appeared in a pornographic video with male porn star James Deen that was distributed by Vivid Video and marketed as being a homemade sex video that ""leaked"". In 2014, Abraham appeared in a second porn video with Deen, with a press release announcing her second sex tape Farrah 2: Backdoor and More in February stating: ""it's no 'fake' 'leak'—it's the real, raw, ridiculous deal, and it suits Farrah's underhanded personality herself.""[23] Farrah reportedly earned $1 million selling her first sex tape with James Deen.[24] Later that month, Abraham appeared in the TV special Being Farrah, a continuation of Teen Mom; Bookout, Lowell, and Portwood were featured in the specials Being Maci, Being Catelynn, and Being Amber, respectively.[25] Their successes prompted MTV to consider reviving the series without Abraham, who the other women were concerned was an inappropriate influence on their children.[26]

In January 2014, Abraham was cast for the fourth season of Couples Therapy. However, Brian Dawe claimed that he was hired by Abraham to appear as her on-screen boyfriend and ultimately did not appear on the program alongside her.[27] Abraham consequently became the only cast member in series history to continue therapy without a partner, and was refocused on repairing her relationship with her mother.[28]

In March 2014, Abraham returned to the music industry with the release of the song ""Blowin'"" and the simultaneous premiere of its accompanying music video. She stated that she treats music as a ""hobby, not my career move.""[29] In August 2014, she signed a contract with Palazio's Gentleman's Club in Austin, Texas, for $544,000 for a residency until New Year's Eve.[citation needed]

In October 2017, Farrah was fired from the show by producer Morgan J. Freeman because of her work in the adult entertainment industry.[30] She was later replaced by Bristol Palin and Cheyenne Floyd.

Celebrity Big Brother

In 2015, Abraham appeared on the 16th series of the British television series Celebrity Big Brother, representing the United States. On September 18, she became the fifth housemate to be evicted. She was not in the top four highest-voted housemates, and her fellow housemate, Austin Armacost, chose to evict her. She had spent 23 days in the house.[31]

On 22 September 2015, she appeared as a panelist on the Celebrity Big Brother's Bit on the Side after-show and got into a heated argument with fellow panelist, Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. The show was taken off air 10 minutes early after a ""clash"" between panelists. Abraham and Janice Dickinson were given police cautions by Hertfordshire Police.[32]

Personal life

The “Finesse” Remix Is Proof That Bruno Mars Should Remake All His Songs with Cardi B,https://www.gq.com/story/finesse-remix-bruno-mars-cardi-b,www.gq.com,7,1,"Somewhere along the way, Bruno Mars went from a lovable cornball with a fondness for fedoras to the greatest male performer in the world who now enjoys a wide variety of fun hats. (I would take a bullet for him.) Last night, Mars dropped a music video for the remix of ""Finesse,"" already one of the sleeper jams off 24K Magic, and made the wise decision to pay Cardi B a lot of money for a feature.

AND HELLO IT IS A BOP:

Bruno Mars' decision to rebrand as a ""32 Things Only ’90s Kids Will Remember"" BuzzFeed quiz is truly the greatest musical innovation the world has ever witnessed. It needs its own Harvard Business School case study. It's like getting sucked into a black hole and encountering the fun inverse of Justin Timberlake going full country in a parallel dimension.

And the pairing with Bardi, whose true gift is having more fun than anyone else around her, hits all the feel-good throwback notes that make you nostalgic for a time when the threat of nuclear winter felt slightly less imminent. Let's hope Bruno Mars remixes his whole album and Cardi B is a guest on every single track."
Adele Invites Grenfell Tower Survivors to ‘Despicable Me 3’ Screening – Variety,https://variety.com/2017/film/news/adele-despicable-me-3-grenfell-tower-fire-survivors-screening-1202517086/,variety.com,94,1,"Adele has been busy raising money for the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, but now she’s also raising spirits for her fellow Londoners.

The Grammy-winning singer held a private screening of the film “Despicable Me 3” for some of the tragedy’s younger survivors and their families just before the weekend.

According to a source with The Sun, Adele sees aiding her community as a full-time job now that Adele Live 2017 is over.

“Being a local Londoner, she’s made no secret about how personally affected she was by the Grenfell Tower blaze and wants to help in every way she can,” claims the source. “While she’s working hard behind the scenes to raise cash, she wanted to treat residents to a night of fun and help take their minds off what happened and organised a private viewing of the brand new ‘Despicable Me 3’ movie.”

Dozens of residents joined Adele for the animated movie on Thursday.

At least 80 people were killed when a fire broke out in the 24-story West London building on June 14. Firefighters originally warned occupants to remain in their apartments, but improper cladding caused the fourth floor fridge-freezer fire to alarmingly accelerate. A final death toll is not expected to be released until at least 2018, but around 255 people are said to have survived.

Adele previously implored her fans to donate to her Grenfell Tower fund while performing at Wembley Stadium back in June.

“It’s been two weeks since the fire, and still the people who were affected by it are homeless,” she said in a pre-show video message. “I promise that the money we raise together will go directly to the people who are living in that block.”

Adele’s act of charity just so happens to coincide with the news that “Despicable Me” is officially the highest-grossing animated franchise of all time. The “Minions” family of films has now grossed $3.528 billion worldwide, beating the five “Shrek” movies’ previous $3.51 billion record."
"‘Bad Times at the El Royale’ Trailer Features Shirtless Chris Hemsworth, Jeff Bridges’ Fake Priest",https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bad-times-at-the-el-royale-trailer-chris-hemsworth-jeff-bridges-1202918807/,variety.com,57,1,"A disheveled Jeff Bridges highlights the latest trailer for Fox’s noir thriller “Bad Times at the El Royale,” portraying a decidedly unreligious priest at a run-down Lake Tahoe hotel on the California-Nevada border.

Bridges plays one of seven strangers who meet at the El Royale over the course of a single night, including a shirtless Chris Hemsworth, a gun-toting gangster played by Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo’s singer, and a vacuum cleaner salesman portrayed by Jon Hamm. Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Nick Offerman also star, with Drew Goddard directing from his own script. Goddard also produced “Bad Times.”

Bridges is warned by the clerk, “This is not a place for a priest, father,” and admits later in the trailer, “Can I confess something to you? I’m not really a priest.”

It’s not quite clear from the trailer why the characters have come to the El Royale and the studio’s description of the plot is somewhat obscure: “Seven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe’s El Royale, a run-down hotel with a dark past. Over the course of one fateful night, everyone will have a last shot at redemption … before everything goes to hell.”

Bridges received his seventh Oscar nomination last year for “Hell or High Water.” Goddard received an Academy Award nom in 2016 for best adapted screenplay for “The Martian” and directed Hemsworth in 2012’s “The Cabin in the Woods” from a script he co-wrote with Joss Whedon.

“Bad Times at the El Royale” opens Oct. 12."

Bill Cosby trial: Topless protester charges towards comedian as retrial begins,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cosby-trial-topless-protester-charges-towards-comedian-as-retrial-begins/,www.cbsnews.com,27,1,"MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Pa. -- A topless protester with ""Women's Lives Matter"" written on her body jumped a barricade and got within a few feet of Bill Cosby on Monday as the comedian walked into a suburban Philadelphia courthouse for the start of his sexual assault retrial. The woman, who was later identified as an actress that appeared on several episodes of ""The Cosby Show,"" ran in front of the 80-year-old comedian Monday but was intercepted by sheriff's deputies.

Cosby seemed startled by the commotion as protesters chanted at him, but he was not touched and is uninjured.

He was led into the courthouse after the woman was led away in handcuffs.

A protester is detained after Bill Cosby arrives for his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse, Monday, April 9, 2018, in Norristown, Pa. Corey Perrine / AP

The district attorney's office later identified the woman as Nicolle Rochelle, 39, of Little Falls, N.J. The office says she entered a restricted area outside the courthouse. She was charged with disorderly conduct.

Rochelle is listed online as a New Jersey-based actress who appeared on four episodes of the Cosby show between 1990 and 1992.

The European feminist group Femen claimed Rochelle as one of its own and said she aimed to call attention to sexual violence and the need to hold perpetrators responsible.

Femen leader Inna Shevchenko told The Associated Press the activist was seeking to defend Cosby's alleged victims. She said it's the group's ""contribution to the global revolt launched by #MeToo.""

The Femen movement started in Ukraine in 2009 and has spread to multiple countries, staging unauthorized topless protests against religious institutions, far-right politicians and other targets seen as oppressing women.

Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt praised the deputies for stopping the protester. But he says more is needed to ensure Cosby's safety, telling The Associated Press, ""You never know who's going to want to make a name for themselves.""

The protester was among about a half dozen people chanting in support of Cosby's accuser. She had ""Women's Lives Matter"" written in red ink on her chest and stomach along with other phrases in black and red all over her body.

The disruption came ahead of opening statements, which were delayed while the judge sorted through allegations raised late Friday that a juror told a woman during jury selection that he thought Cosby was guilty. Cosby's lawyers want the juror removed from the case.

Prosecutors have lined up a parade of accusers to make the case that the man revered as ""America's Dad"" lived a double life as one of Hollywood's biggest predators.

Cosby is fighting back with a new, high-profile lawyer and an aggressive strategy: attacking Andrea Constand as a greedy liar and casting the other women testifying as bandwagon accusers looking for a share of the spotlight.

""You've seen previews and coming attractions, but things have changed,"" said professor Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Cosby's first trial last spring ended with jurors unable to reach a unanimous verdict after five days of tense deliberations on charges that the man who made millions of viewers laugh as wise and understanding Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" drugged and molested Constand at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004.

The 80-year-old comedian, who has said the sexual contact was consensual, faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

His retrial is taking place in a radically changed and potentially more hostile environment. The #MeToo movement caught fire four months after the first trial, raising awareness of sexual misconduct as it toppled Harvey Weinstein, Sen. Al Franken, Matt Lauer and other powerful men.

Nearly every potential juror questioned for the case this time knew about #MeToo.

Kristen Houser of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center said that could help prosecutors overcome the skepticism some jurors had last time about Constand's yearlong wait to report her allegations to the police.

""The #MeToo movement is amplifying what experts have been saying for decades: People are ashamed, they're confused, they can't believe somebody they trust would hurt them, and then they worry that others won't believe them,"" Houser said.

After limiting the focus of the first trial, Judge Steven O'Neill has been willing to let both sides push the retrial well beyond Constand's allegations.

This time, O'Neill is letting prosecutors have five additional accusers testify - including model Janice Dickinson. The judge allowed just one other accuser to take the stand last time.

""This one will be harder for the defense,"" Levenson said. This time, Constand ""is not alone, and there is strength in numbers.""

CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman said ""the trial completely changes"" in light of the #MeToo movement. The voices of five women rather than one could also help prosecutors in their attempt to show that Cosby had an ""M.O."" of drugging and raping women, Klieman said.

In another difference, the judge this time is letting Cosby's legal team call as a witness a former co-worker of Constand's at Temple University who said Constand spoke of setting up a ""high-profile person"" so she could sue and enjoy a big payday. Constand's lawyer has said the co-worker is lying.

The judge also decided the jury can hear the answer to one of the biggest questions hanging over the case: How much did Cosby pay Constand to settle her lawsuit against him more than a decade ago? The two sides agreed at the first trial not to mention the lawsuit.

Cosby lawyer Tom Mesereau, who won an acquittal in Michael Jackson's 2005 child molestation case, said the jury will learn ""just how greedy"" Constand was.

In a twist, the judge hinted that he might not allow jurors to hear Cosby's lurid deposition testimony about giving quaaludes to women before sex. He said he would rule on it during the trial. Cosby testified in 2005 and 2006 as part of Constand's lawsuit.

The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand and Dickinson have done."

Carrie Frances Fisher (October 21, 1956 – December 27, 2016) was an American actress and writer.[1] She played Princess Leia in the original Star Wars films (1977–1983) and reprised the role in The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017)—a posthumous release that was dedicated to her[2][3]—and The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the latter using unreleased footage from The Force Awakens.[4][5] Her other film credits include Shampoo (1975), The Blues Brothers (1980), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), The 'Burbs (1989), When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Soapdish (1991), and The Women (2008).[6] She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances in the NBC sitcom 30 Rock (2007) and the Channel 4 series Catastrophe (2017).

Fisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including Postcards from the Edge and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its nonfiction book, Wishful Drinking, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards from the Edge which garnered her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special. She worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor, including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others.[7] An Entertainment Weekly article from May 1992 described Fisher as ""one of the most sought-after doctors in town.""[8][9]

Fisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear together in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. She earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction.[10] Fisher died of a sudden cardiac arrest in December 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017,[11] and was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album the following year. In 2023, she posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[12]

Early life [ edit ]

Carrie Frances Fisher[13] was born on October 21, 1956, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California,[14] to actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher.[15] Fisher's paternal grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants,[16][17][18][19][20] while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of English and Scots-Irish descent.[21][22][23][24]

Fisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959 after it was revealed shortly following the death of Elizabeth Taylor's husband, Mike Todd, that Eddie Fisher had been having an affair with her.[25] Eddie Fisher and Taylor married that same year and divorced in 1964. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores.[26][27] Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973 when Fisher was 17 years old.[28]

Fisher ""hid in books"" as a child, becoming known in her family as ""the bookworm"".[29] She spent her earliest years reading classic literature and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 16, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), also starring her mother.[30] Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in her dropping out of high school.[31] In 1973, she enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months.[29][32] Following her time there, she was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.[33][34][35]

Career [ edit ]

1970s [ edit ]

She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved. In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess—feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think. —director George Lucas [ 36 ]

Fisher made her film debut in 1975 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo, filmed in mid-1974, when she was age 17.[6] In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' space-fantasy film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.[37] Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.[38]

In April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo.[39] The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind.[40] At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.[41] That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production Star Wars Holiday Special, and sang in the last scene.[42]

1980s [ edit ]

Fisher appeared in the film The Blues Brothers as Jake's vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as ""Mystery Woman"".[43] While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver which ""saved my life"", according to Fisher.[44] She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and appeared with her Star Wars co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980, issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[45] She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of Agnes of God in 1983,[46][47] a run which overlapped with her mother's appearance in the Broadway company of Woman of the Year.[48][49]

In 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi, and posed in the character's metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[50][51] The costume later achieved a following of its own.[52] In 1986, she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.

In 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989, Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.[6]

1990s [ edit ]

In 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of Postcards from the Edge, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, and Dennis Quaid.[53] Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film Drop Dead Fred in 1991, and played a therapist in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997).[6] During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels Surrender the Pink (1990) and Delusions of Grandma (1993). Fisher wrote an episode of the television sitcom Roseanne entitled ""Arsenic and Old Mom"", in which her mother Debbie Reynolds made a guest appearance. Fisher also did uncredited script work for movies such as Lethal Weapon 3 (where she wrote some of Rene Russo's dialogue), Outbreak (also starring Russo), The Wedding Singer,[54] and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.[55]

2000s [ edit ]

In the 2000 film Scream 3, Fisher played a former actress who acknowledges she looks like Fisher,[56] and in 2001 she played a nun in the Kevin Smith comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She also co-wrote the TV comedy film These Old Broads (2001), of which she was also co-executive producer. It starred her mother Debbie Reynolds, as well as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, and Shirley MacLaine.[57] In 2003 Fisher played Mother Superior, another nun, in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.[58][59]

In addition to acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers.[60][61] She did uncredited polishes on movies in a 15-year stretch from 1991 to 2005. She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and the dialogue for the Star Wars prequel scripts.[60] Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary Dreams on Spec in 2007. In an interview in 2004, Fisher said she no longer did much script doctoring.[61]

Fisher also voiced Peter Griffin's boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom Family Guy[62] and wrote the introduction for a book of photographs titled Hollywood Moms, which was published in 2001.[63] Fisher published a sequel to Postcards, The Best Awful There Is, in 2004. In 2005, Women in Film & Video – DC recognized Fisher with the Women of Vision Award.[64]

Fisher wrote and performed in her one-woman play Wishful Drinking at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles from November 2006 to January 2007.[65] Her show then played throughout 2008 at the Berkeley Repertory Theater,[66] San Jose, the Hartford Stage,[67] the Arena Stage[68] and Boston.[69] Fisher published her autobiographical book, also titled Wishful Drinking, based on her successful play in December 2008 and embarked on a media tour. In 2009, Fisher returned to the stage with her play at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.[70] Wishful Drinking then opened on Broadway in New York at Studio 54 and played an extended run from October 2009 until January 2010.[71][72] In December 2009, Fisher's audiobook recording of Wishful Drinking earned her a nomination for a 2009 Grammy Award in the Best Spoken Word Album category.[73]

Fisher joined Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne on Saturday evenings in 2007 for The Essentials with informative and entertaining conversation on Hollywood's best films. She guest-starred in the episode titled ""Sex and Another City"" from season 3 of Sex and the City with Sarah Jessica Parker. On October 25, 2007, Fisher guest-starred as Rosemary Howard on the second-season episode of 30 Rock called ""Rosemary's Baby"", for which she received an Emmy Award nomination.[74] On April 28, 2008, she was a guest on Deal or No Deal.[75] In 2008, she also had a cameo as a doctor in the Star Wars-related comedy Fanboys.

When asked if she was still working as a script doctor in December 2008, she said: ""I haven't done it for a few years. I did it for many years, and then younger people came to do it and I started to do new things. It was a long, very lucrative episode of my life. But it's complicated to do that. Now it's all changed, actually. Now in order to get a rewrite job, you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script. So they can get all the notes from all the different writers, keep the notes and not hire you. That's free work and that's what I always call life-wasting events.""[76]

2010s [ edit ]

In 2010, HBO aired a feature-length documentary based on a special live performance of Fisher's Wishful Drinking stage production.[77] At the time of her death, Fisher had been preparing a sequel to the one-woman play.[78]

Fisher appeared on the seventh season of Entourage in the summer of 2010.[77] She was among the featured performers at the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness,[79] and her fellow roasters' reliance on weight and menopause jokes.[80] Fisher joked that she had no idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until ""they explained that we were actually good friends, and that apparently we have worked together.""[81] Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne's struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity ""whose action figure is worth more than you are.""[82]

She was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.[83] She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show QI that was broadcast on December 25, 2014.[84] Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series Catastrophe, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015.[85][86] Her last appearance on Catastrophe, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears[87] and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.

In a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in Episode VII of the Star Wars series. Fisher claimed that Leia was ""Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.""[88] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.[89]

In a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying ""as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.""[90]

In March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where Star Wars Episode VII filming would take place.[91] On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. Star Wars Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.[92]

In Rogue One (2016), which is set just before the original trilogy, young versions of Leia and the Peter Cushing character Grand Moff Tarkin appear through computer animation.[93][94] Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) shortly before her death.[95] Director Rian Johnson has stated that many of Fisher's own ideas made it into the film, and that she supplied a few of Leia's lines.[96] Fisher appeared posthumously in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) via unreleased footage from The Force Awakens.[4][5][97]

Fisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[98][99] Her audiobook recording of the memoir earned her the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, awarded 13 months after her death.[100]

Fisher and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,[101] a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and was broadcast on January 7, 2017.[102]

Fisher appeared as herself in the final episode of series 1 of Urban Myths (2017) but the episode was never broadcast following objections by the Jackson family to Joseph Fiennes' portrayal of Michael Jackson in the episode.

2020s [ edit ]

Fisher was featured in the film Wonderwell with Rita Ora, which was filmed in mid-2016 in Italy;[103] it received a limited theatrical release on June 23, 2023, followed by a digital release.[104]

Personal life [ edit ]

Marriages and relationships [ edit ]

In her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars in 1976.[105]

Fisher met musician Paul Simon through her friend actress Shelley Duvall in 1978, and the pair began dating.[106][107]

In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: ""We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.""[108]

Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce.[109][108] During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song ""Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War"". Simon's song ""Hearts and Bones"" is about their romance,[110][111] and she is referred to in his song ""Graceland"", which was written after their divorce.[112] Fisher said she felt privileged to appear in Simon's songs.[112]

Fisher subsequently had a relationship with the Creative Artists Agency's principal talent agent, Bryan Lourd. Their only child, Billie Lourd, was born in 1992. Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is ""Billy"". Carrie Fisher's relationship with Bryan Lourd ended when he left her for a man. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.[113]

Fisher had a close relationship with English singer-songwriter James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: ""Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.""[37]

On February 26, 2005, R. Gregory ""Greg"" Stevens, a 42-year-old lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher's California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as ""cocaine and oxycodone use"" but added chronic and apparently previously undiagnosed heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word ""overdose"", but that wording is not in the final report.[114] In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: ""I was a nut for a year, and in that year I took drugs again.""[37]

In her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French bulldog named Gary, that she brought to numerous appearances and interviews.[115] Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.[116]

Advocacy [ edit ]

Fisher described herself as an ""enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God.""[117] She was raised Protestant,[118] but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Jewish Orthodox friends.[119]

During the 1988 presidential election, Fisher was supportive to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.[120]

In 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that ""her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.""[10]

Fisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy,[121] animal rights,[122] and LGBT causes.[123] She was open about her experiences caring for friends who had AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.[124] She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation,[125] and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.[126]

She was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.[127]

Bipolar disorder and drug use [ edit ]

During appearances on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication.[128] She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to ""dial down"" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder.[129] She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (""the wild ride of a mood"") and Pam (""who stands on the shore and sobs"").[130] ""Drugs made me feel more normal"", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. ""They contained me.""[129] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult.[131] This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments.[132] At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to ""blow apart the cement"" in her brain.[133] In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment. Her 2011 book Shockaholic describes these treatments.[134]

In another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. ""Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter"", she noted.[135] In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills.[136] She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, ""I've already played Suzanne.""[137]

Death [ edit ]

After finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on an episode of 8 Out of 10 Cats in the United Kingdom, broadcast December 21, 2016), Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she had a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed.[138][a] A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing;[141] another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger unresponsive prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.[142][143]

On the morning of December 27, 2016, after being in intensive care for four days, Fisher died at the age of 60 at the UCLA Medical Center.[144] Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother's death in a statement to the press.[142] Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.[145]

On January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated ""cardiac arrest/deferred"" as the cause of death, with more tests to be expected.[146] In a June 16, 2017 news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors.[147] A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs and whether they contributed to her death.[148] Her daughter stated that Fisher ""battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases.... I know my Mom, she'd want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.""[149] In her 2008 work Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote that ""no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.""[150] After Fisher's death, several news sources and magazines honored her request in their obituaries,[151][152] with Bustle featuring a fantastical reimagining of Fisher's last moments as an ascent into space.[153]

On December 28, 2016, the day after Fisher's death, her mother, Debbie Reynolds, had a stroke at the home of her son, Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements.[154] She was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she died later that afternoon.[155][156] According to Todd, Reynolds had said, ""I want to be with Carrie"" immediately before she had the stroke.[157][158][b] On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. Fisher was cremated while her mother was entombed. A portion of Fisher's ashes was placed beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.[160] The remainder of those ashes are held in a giant novelty Prozac pill.[161]

Legacy [ edit ]

In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after her death, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, ""Carrie Fisher / May The Force Be With You Always / Hope"".[1] Fans also gathered at the Yoda Fountain outside the Lucasfilm offices in San Francisco.[162] In June 2021, it was announced that Fisher would receive an official star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022. She received the star on Star Wars Day 2023.[12][163]

In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars was raised.[164][165] Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinema theaters and other sites.[166][167][168] On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.[169] Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards In Memoriam segment.[170] On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds' website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.[171] The 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi was dedicated to her memory. On October 27, 2023, James Blunt released an album including a track called ""Dark Thought"" about the death of Fisher, who was a friend of his.[172]

Filmography [ edit ]

During her almost five-decade-long career, Fisher had appearances in over 50 films, as well as various television series, documentaries, late night talk shows, video games, and commercials. Her credits also include writing novels, screenplays, television specials and series episodes.

‘Star Wars: Episode IX’: Everything we know so far,https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/star-wars-episode-ix-release-date-trailer-cast-news/,www.digitaltrends.com,274,1,"There’s been plenty of speculation about the future of the Star Wars franchise since 2017’s Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi hit theaters, and now the premiere of Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker is here The final, full-length trailer for The Rise of Skywalker offered some intriguing hints as to how the Skywalker saga will conclude, including a brief scene from an epic space battle featuring more than a few iconic ships, and now that we’ve seen it, we’ve got our own opinions that don’t necessarily follow the critics’ consensus.

The Rise of Skywalker brings back director J.J. Abrams to close out this arc of the iconic sci-fi saga after he helmed 2015’s franchise-relaunching Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens. While Star Wars: Episode IX is now available for your viewing pleasure, if you’ve yet to see the film, here’s everything to know ahead of the action.

Jedi mind tricks

In a special event hosted in the game Fortnite, Disney released another clip from the upcoming film.

Fortnite Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker Event Exclusive Movie Clip

This time, we see Rey, Finn, and Poe land on an Imperial space station (which looks strangely familiar to previous films’ Death Star scenes) and instantly take out a few Stormtroopers. They run into a corridor where they’re stopped by two more Stormtroopers and look to be done for. However, Rey raises a hand and pulls a classic page from Obi-Wan Kenobi’s book, telling the Stormtroopers, “It’s okay that we’re here.”

They agree, after which Poe asks Finn, “Does she do that to us?”

It’s a little comic relief following a potentially significant reveal: That Rey has fully embraced and mastered the Jedi ability to control minds.

A telling new clip

A clip from Episode IX released a week before Rise of Skywalker hit theaters features the voice of James Earl Jones, who famously voiced Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - “Kylo Ren Meets the Emperor” Clip

Emperor Palpatine’s voice joins that of Vader, as are the voices of Supreme Leader Snoke, taunting Kylo Ren.

“I have been every voice you have ever heard inside your head,” the Sith voices hiss at Kylo, implying that Palpatine’s powers may have conquered death long enough to pull the strings for the rise of the First Order. Of course, without additional context, it’s impossible to say definitively what’s going on here and that, naturally, is the point of the teaser.

At the very least, the clip shows that The Rise of Skywalker makes a concerted effort to tie together all three trilogies to bring the Star Wars saga to a close.

They can fly now

Disney released a clip from The Rise of Skywalker on November 25 featuring Rey, Finn, Poe, and a few more familiar characters racing across a desert while being pursued by stormtroopers. They weren’t your usual First Order troops, however, as the stormtroopers took to the sky using jetpacks in the 30-second clip, prompting some surprise from the hero characters. Yes, they can fly now.

Final trailer and ticket sales

The final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (see above) premiered — much like past trailers for the episodic installments of the franchise — during a broadcast of the NFL’s Monday Night Football on October 21. Tickets for The Rise of Skywalker officially went on sale just before the trailer’s debut.

Hello, Babu

As part of Lucasfilm’s annual “Force Friday” campaign, the studio revealed a new character who debuted in The Rise of Skywalker: Babu Frik.

The character’s official description (via StarWars.com) reads as follows: “The tiny Anzellan droidsmith … works among the Spice Runners of Kijimi and can reprogram or modify virtually any droid — regardless of the security measures protecting its systems.”

Welcome to the Star Wars universe, Babu.

D23 preview: The last Jedi goes dark?

Disney gave Star Wars fans an early look at some new footage from The Rise of Skywalker during the company’s D23 Expo in August, and the preview generated quite a bit of discussion due to its closing scene: A shot of Rey (Daisy Ridley) in a dark cloak, wielding a double-bladed, red lightsaber similar to the one Darth Maul used in The Phantom Menace.

Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker | D23 Special Look

Along with that cryptic tease, the video also featured one of the repurposed scenes from the prior films that feature the late Carrie Fisher as Leia, as well as a few other notable moments.

A foreboding poster

Revealed at Disney’s surprisingly packed D23 Expo event in Anaheim, California, the poster for the film is a daringly imaginative battle scene between our hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and a fully masked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The previously rumored return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is front and center as he looks on at the fight from the skies above with demonic eyes.

A tight schedule

The film’s late change in directors (by Star Wars standards, at least) was keenly felt by the production team, and prompted some creative maintenance of the filming schedule, according to Rise of Skywalker editor Maryann Brandon.

In an interview with Express U.K., the longtime collaborator with Abrams revealed that the tight production schedule for the film had her take the unusual step of cutting footage on set, while they were still filming.

“When we did The Force Awakens, we started in May and we finished shooting in October, and we were out [the following] Christmas,” she explained. “For this film, we didn’t start until August, so we weren’t done until February shooting — so we have four months less time, and it’s a very big film.”

“So I convinced JJ to let me cut on the set,” she said. “He was like, ‘No, we never do that.’ I [said], ‘Just try it, so I can start turning over shots.'”

The result was a situation in which Brandon was rarely more than 10 feet from Abrams at any given point during the filming of Rise of Skywalker, editing the movie as it was being filmed.

“So if the camera would move 10 feet, I would move 10 feet,” she recalled. “I was everywhere.”

More details (and photos) emerge

In May, Vanity Fair published an in-depth preview of Rise of Skywalker featuring some of the first looks at the characters — both new and returning — that appear in the trilogy-ending chapter of the saga.

Among the biggest revelations from the preview include the return of the Knights of Ren, and the confirmation of Keri Russell’s character in the film, a “masked scoundrel” known as Zorri Bliss.

A photo also revealed the first look at Naomi Ackie as Jannah, who joins Finn (John Boyega) in one of the photos, riding into battle on creatures known Orbaks.

The first look

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker - Official Trailer

The first trailer for The Rise of Skywalker dropped in front of a packed crowd at Star Wars Celebration in Chicago, and it revealed much more than just the film’s title. The trailer would be viewed more than 111 million times within the first 24 hours it was available, according to Deadline, receiving 20 million more views than the trailer for Episode VIII — The Last Jedi did during the same period of time.

As far as what the trailer revealed, Mark Hamill provided the preview’s evocative voice-over, while footage of Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa — which was originally filmed for The Force Awakens — tugged at fans’ heartstrings. Billy Dee Williams as the elder Lando Calrissian looked as dapper as ever sitting in the Millennium Falcon’s cockpit.

More Star Wars News

The trailer’s biggest surprise came at the very end, however, when a maniacal laugh took over the soundtrack. That cackle belongs to none other than former Emperor Palpatine, who (supposedly) died at the end of Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi. Just in case there was any confusion, Palpatine actor Ian McDiarmid took the Star Wars Celebration stage after the trailer finished playing and, in character, growled, “Roll it again.”

Otherwise, the Star Wars Celebration Episode IX panel was light on details, although Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy let the assembled cast members share a few small tidbits. Naomi Ackie’s new character is named Jannah. The Rise of Skywalker brings the sequel trilogy characters together for a single adventure, and BB-8 has a new droid pal named DIO, who is just as cute as you would imagine.

A leaked peek?

Just a couple of weeks before Star Wars Celebration Chicago alleged promotional materials for the film leaked on Making Star Wars. The images, which include a collage and character sheets, confirm a number of long-standing rumors and offer fans a glimpse of some of Star Wars: Episode IX‘s new characters.

Rey takes center stage on the “leaked” image, dressed in an outfit that recalls both Luke Skywalker’s all-white get-up in Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope and Padme’s costume during Attack of the Clones’ final battle scene. Poe Dameron is wearing full-on Resistance fighter garb, Finn holds a blaster, and C-3PO wields a Wookiee bowcaster, just like previous reports said he would. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, who first appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is conspicuously absent.

On the villains’ side, Kylo Ren seems to have reforged his mask and is flanked by a group of similarly clad soldiers who are most likely the mysterious Knights of Ren. Kylo’s long-rumored legion of red Stormtroopers also appears as does a masked woman who the character sheets call “Zorri,” and who matches previous descriptions of the new character played by The Americans’ Keri Russell.

The character sheets correctly identify Naomi Ackie’s bow-wielding character as Jannah and offer a very blurry glimpse at Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, whose fashion sense doesn’t seem to have changed much over the past 40 years.

The end of an era

On January 15, 2019, Abrams shared some momentous news on Twitter: Principal photography on Star Wars: Episode IX has wrapped after a six-month shoot, marking the end of filming on both Disney’s sequel trilogy and the Skywalker family saga as a whole.

“It feels impossible, but today wrapped photography on Episode IX,” Abrams wrote alongside a photo of stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac embracing on set. “There is no adequate way to thank this truly magical crew and cast. I’m forever indebted to you all.”

Abrams wasn’t the only one who felt that way. Boyega posted the same photo on his social media feed, along with a heartfelt message. “That’s a wrap on Star Wars episode 9 and the end to a chapter of my life that I couldn’t be more thankful for,” Boyega said. “It really has been a joy to be in these movies surrounded by amazing people. JJ thank you for making my dreams come true.”

Cosmic cameos

The Star Wars saga has a long history of bringing in famous actors, musicians, and other familiar faces for small parts — often under heavy makeup or costumes — as a nod to some of the franchise’s most high-profile fans.

Star Wars: Celebrity Chef Jamie Oliver Lands Episode IX Cameo https://t.co/3LXRF7QEGZ pic.twitter.com/5vNAsNsSK8 — CBR (@CBR) December 26, 2018

According to The Sun, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver suited up as a First Order stormtrooper for Episode IX. Oliver, who hosted the popular BBC series The Naked Chef for its three-season run, was offered the part after gaining attention for his Star Wars fandom over the years.

Oliver joins award-winning musician Ed Sheeran, who will also have a cameo in Episode IX, with both men playing First Order stormtroopers in the film.

One year later

Given how little time elapsed between the events of Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens and Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, it comes as a bit of a surprise that Episode IX jumps ahead in the timeline a bit for its story.

Speaking to Empire Magazine about the film, actor John Boyega — who portrayed former First Order stormtrooper Finn in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi — indicated that Episode IX will pick up “roughly one year” after the events of its 2017 predecessor. At Star Wars Celebration 2019, panelists confirmed that there would be a sizable time jump between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.

Rumor patrol: Knights of Ren

As with any Star Wars movie, there’s no shortage of rumors circling Episode IX, and a few have sparked quite a bit of discussion in mainstream circles.

The mysterious Knights of Ren were also the subject of a popular rumor making the rounds, with ComicBook.com reporting that a person present at a Disney marketing event confirmed that the shadowy group seen in Episode VII — The Force Awakens and led by Kylo Ren will indeed be in Episode IX.

“They will definitely be in the next movie,” writes the unidentified source. “They did show numerous pictures/artwork of them.”

The Doctor is in

One of cinema’s most popular sci-fi franchises will draw from the ranks of one of television’s longest-running sci-fi sagas.

In late August 2018, former Doctor Who star Matt Smith (pictured above) was reported to be the latest casting addition to Episode IX.

Smith, who played the 11th Doctor in the wildly popular British sci-fi series and recently earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his performance in the Netflix series The Crown, will play an unidentified “key role” in the Star Wars sequel, according to Variety.

A bittersweet beginning

Abrams commemorated the August 1 start of production on Episode IX with his first post on Twitter, which acknowledged the absence of franchise veteran Carrie Fisher on the set and thanked Episode VIII director Rian Johnson and Star Wars creator George Lucas for getting the saga to this point.

Official cast

On July 27, Lucasfilm’s official Star Wars page listed the major cast list, including the big names returning and those joining anew the latest film in the franchise. And yes, that means Billy Dee Williams officially returns as the iconic Lando Calrissian, as does Mark Hamill which, for reasons we won’t specify here, may come as a surprise to some. Follow below for the official cast list:

Officially returning for Episode IX are Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, and Billie Lourd.

Joining the cast for their first Star Wars experience are Naomi Ackie (Dr. Who), Richard E. Grant, and Keri Russell. In addition, veteran Star Wars actors returning include Williams (as promised), Hamill (Luke Skywalker), and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO).

But those aren’t the only familiar faces coming back. The announcement states that the late Carrie Fisher’s character, Leia Organa, also returns for the film “using previously unreleased footage shot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” This may come as a surprise to some following news that no CG version of Fisher’s character would be used for Episode IX (seemingly implying Leia would not return). However, Episode IX director J.J. Abrams made a statement to alleviate concerns.

“We desperately loved Carrie Fisher,” Abrams said. “Finding a truly satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga without her eluded us. We were never going to recast, or use a CG character. With the support and blessing from her daughter, Billie, we have found a way to honor Carrie’s legacy and role as Leia in Episode IX by using unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.”

A tricky new title

Star Wars films are notorious for using working titles to throw off the public and keep production costs low in terms of locations and services. Episode VI — Return of the Jedi was shot under the guise of a horror movie called Blue Harvest. Meanwhile, Episode II — Attack of the Clones poked fun at the negative response to prequel trilogy’s Gungan leader with the title Jar-Jar’s Big Adventure.

Sometimes the production title can offer clues, though they may not make sense until after the film is released. Fantha Tracks has reported that the working title for Episode IX was trIXie. The site claimed that “the same research methods and public sources were used by the same team to uncover the production names of every Disney-era Star Wars film to date.”

The Force Awakens was shot under the title AVCO, which Bleeding Cool reported was the name of the theater in Los Alamos where a young J.J. Abrams saw the first Star Wars film. So what does trIXie refer to, if anything? It appears to simply be a way to get the roman numeral for the number 9 in the title.

Reunion time

Following in the footsteps of the Star Wars trilogies that came before it, the current three-part story arc had its main characters separating in Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, the middle chapter of the saga (much like the characters did in Episode II — Attack of the Clones and Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back). As with those previous trilogies, though, the cast reunited for one big team-up for the concluding installment.

Asked about Episode IX during a convention in Washington, D.C. in 2018, Boyega said he expects the film to bring together his character, Finn, with Daisy Ridley’s character, Rey. The pair have been separated since the events of Episode VII — The Force Awakens, but that period apart is nearing its end.

“I haven’t read the script for Episode IX,” he said (via SlashFilm). “But Daisy did shoot me a text saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I just heard from J.J. [Abrams], and we’re back together.’ That’s what I’m really excited about, is Finn and Rey back together again.”

Different endings, same result?

While discussing the differences in working with Star Wars directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson, Hamill revealed how the creator of the sci-fi saga, Lucas, planned to handle the later years of his iconic character, Luke Skywalker.

“I happen to know that George didn’t kill Luke until the end of [Episode] IX, after he trained Leia,” Hamill told IGN. “Which is another thread that was never played upon [in The Last Jedi].”

Although most of Lucas’ plans for a sequel trilogy were reportedly scrapped when Disney took over the franchise, The Last Jedi did get to a point with some of its main characters that has a lot in common with those early outlines. Luke’s death occurred one episode earlier, and Leia (Carrie Fisher) did show some aptitude with The Force in Johnson’s 2017 film.

“George had an overall arc — if he didn’t have all the details, he had sort of an overall feel for where the [sequel trilogy was] going — but this [sequel trilogy] is more like a relay race,” Hamill said of the current saga, which appears to be letting its creative teams take the over-arching events in some unexpected directions, too. “You run and hand the torch off to the next guy, he picks it up and goes.”

The rich get richer

Whatever your thoughts about Episode VIII, most can agree that it was a visually spectacular film. Scenes like the throne room saber battle and Vice Admiral Holdo’s lightspeed strike were breathtaking, thanks to some excellent art direction and production design. Now, the team for Episode IX has a new, distinguished member: Paul Inglis, who served as art director for the excellent (and gorgeous) Blade Runner 2049.

Thanks to a report from Omega Underground, we know Inglis was tapped as the supervising art director for Episode IX, to work alongside Abrams and the production team to define the film’s aesthetic. Inglis’ previous credits also include Skyfall, Game of Thrones, Prometheus, and Children of Men.

A different kind of ship

Some Star Wars fans saw Rey (Ridley) and Poe (Isaac) meet in The Last Jedi and started hoping it was their meet-cute. The single scene was enough to fuel shipping rumors — so much so that Ridley had to answer a question about it during a promotional event in China. Redditor Niamor89 posted a video (via Sleemo) showing the actress discussing the two Resistance fighters’ possible romantic future. Put simply, she doesn’t really want them to have one.

“It’s wonderful to have relationships that are not romantic,” Ridley said. “I don’t think in films you always need a romantic relationship. I think friend relationships can be romantic in their gestures and their intimacy and all of that. So I think, hopefully — you know, if Rey and Poe get to have some scenes together and stuff — that there will be intimacy, but I think, for me, it doesn’t have to be romantic love.”

Location on loch

The next installment of the Star Wars franchise headed to the highlands — the county of Argyll in the Scottish Highlands, to be precise.

A report in Scotland’s Daily Record indicated that a new Star Wars movie began filming in the western Scottish county of Argyll in June, with shooting taking place in the historic mountain pass known as the Rest and Be Thankful. Although the initial report suggested that it was Johnson’s spinoff trilogy that filmed in Argyll, that series hasn’t entered production — so if a Star Wars movie did indeed shoot in Argyll, it’s most likely Abrams’ Episode IX.

Parent problems, redux

Although The Last Jedi seemed to offer some resolution regarding the mystery of Rey’s lineage, Johnson indicated in an interview with Huffington Post that fans might not have heard the end of that particular identity crisis.

“Anything’s still open, and I’m not writing the next film. [Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio] are doing it,” said Johnson while discussing the revelation about Rey’s parents that has become one of the most polarizing aspects of the film.

Their story will go on

Don’t let the description of Episode IX as a “concluding chapter” mislead you: The stars of the sequel trilogy aren’t going away.

In a November 2017 interview featured on The Star Wars Show, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy indicated that many of the main characters introduced in Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens will continue their stories in Episode IX and beyond the sequel trilogy.

“We’re sitting down now, we’re talking about the next 10 years of Star Wars stories, and we’re looking at, narratively, where that might go,” Kennedy said. “Future stories beyond Episode IX with these new characters — Rey, Poe, Finn, BB-8 — but we’re also looking at working with people who are interested in coming into the Star Wars world and taking us places we haven’t been yet. That’s exciting too because it’s a vast galaxy far, far away.”

Going back to the beginning

After original Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow exited the project in September 2017 due to creative differences with the studio, it didn’t take long for Disney and Lucasfilm to find a new filmmaker to helm the movie — and he was a familiar face to fans of the franchise.

Abrams was named the new director of the film just a week after the post was vacated, with the film’s co-writer, Academy Award winner Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League), also announced at that time.

“With The Force Awakens, J.J. delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy,” Kennedy said in a statement on StarWars.com.

Given the success of Abrams’ franchise-relaunching sequel The Force Awakens, the decision to bring him back for Episode IX seems like a safe bet for the studio.

Release date, updated

Not too long after Abrams was announced as the director of Episode IX, the film also received a new release date.

Star Wars: Episode IX officially hit theaters on December 20, 2019, several months later than its original release date of May 24, 2019.

The new release date has the film arriving in theaters on the same weekend as a live-action feature based on the popular Broadway musical Cats. It also allows the film to carry on the tradition set by the two serialized installments of the Star Wars franchise that immediately precede it, Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, which were both assigned December premieres."

""Married at First Sight"" ended season 5 with a big decision for three couples. So, who among Cody and Danielle, Sheila and Nate, and Anthony and Ashley stayed together? Whose revelation ended up surprising the viewers?

Cody and Danielle struggled with a lack of intimacy and romance in their marriage. The latter made her feelings known to her husband when she said she is not sure if there is still a future for them.

Cody acknowledged that they can choose divorce as an option, which no longer surprised his wife. Cody, however, declared that he would like to stay married as he told Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Decision Day of ""Married at First Sight"" season 5. They agreed to make more effort in making this union last.

Eight weeks of ""Married at First Sight"" only compounded Sheila and Nate's feelings and devotion for each other. Sheila declared that she would like to stay married to Nate. Her husband reciprocated by saying how much he loves his wife over and over.

The couple's issue had been the constant fights and arguments. But in the end, they told Dr. Pepper that they needed to work on communicating with each other to lessen the friction in their marriage.

Ashley and Anthony also confessed to having problems with communicating with each other. The couple discussed the issue of having kids, which Anthony wasn't ready for, and this became a problem.

But both of them didn't want to end their marriage. Despite the fights and the issues, their decision was to stay together at the end of ""Married at First Sight"" season 5.

The biggest surprise, however, was when Anthony declared they will get started on expanding their family when they get home. Ashley was all smiles when the series closed.

""Married at First Sight"" season 5 premiered on October 2016 on Lifetime. This is the first season that ended with all the couples making the final decision for marriage and not divorce."

Executive Vice-President, National Rifle Association

before the

House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime

U. S. House of Representatives May 27, 1999

Our freedoms are already endangered enough by those who oppose them. But I 've learned that a freedom is most at risk when it 's in the hands of honest people who think, for some perceived common good, they ought to give it up.



Today we are a country in shock, still bewildered by what confluence of forces could possibly lead young people to hurt each other.



In that tender state, good people are vulnerable. They want to do something, anything, for the common good. Indeed, some are so perplexed about what to do that legislators admit from the outset that their legislation could not have prevented the very crimes that provoked drafting it.



That's the very definition of a perceived, but fictitious, common good.



As this made-for-TV lawmaking gets played out, it needs a villain. So good Americans have been exposed daily to a well-coordinated systematic bashing of the National Rifle Association 's membership as somehow a reckless societal pathogen, a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution, and reason.



That is a cruel and dangerous lie.



Because nobody --nor any combination of entities you care to add up --has invested even a measurable fraction of what we have invested toward keeping safety and sanity central to the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment.



And nobody is more committed than we are to keeping guns out of criminals 'hands. That's obviously in our best interest. It's just whether you believe you 're more likely to keep guns and criminals apart with new laws you write and ignore, or with existing laws you enforce.



Some think our insistence on enforcement is unreasonable. Others say we oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership. So let's talk about what's reasonable and what's not.



We think it 's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone. That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mental ill are in the system.



This isn 't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to

news interviews and press appearances. But I 've repeatedly emphasized that this Administration must stop illegally keeping records of lawful gun buyers.



In fact, it 's the media 's well-kept secret that the NRA was an early architect and supporter of the National Instant Check System now in place. Congressman McCollum knows we worked with him on instant checks more than a decade ago.

We think it 's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and

pawn shops. But what 's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people like felons who 've walked away from gun stores --instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.



We think it 's reasonable to prevent all juveniles convicted of violent felonies from owning guns,

for life. What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg can prevent your law-abiding son from

inheriting his grandpa 's shotgun collection because Lautenberg classifies him as a gun show dealer who must be federally regulated.



We think it 's reasonable to prosecute more than just two dozen thugs last year for putting illegal guns in criminals 'hands. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg considers legal guns in private hands subject to intrusive federal regulation, even in the privacy of your home.



For a century we 've taught it 's not just reasonable but essential to use safety locks, trigger locks, gun safes or any voluntary means appropriate to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. What's unreasonable is that Lautenberg can put you in prison just for failing to keep records on how many guns you own.

We think it 's reasonable to make gun show instant checks just like gun store instant checks.

What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg could define your Walmart, or your uncle 's skeetshooting range, or your next-door firearms collector, or your local sporting clays competition, or

any person or place with 50 or more firearms as a ""gun show "" subject to mtrusive government regulation. That 's crazy!



We think it 's reasonable to demand strict prosecution of criminal activity, whether it takes place in

a big-city alleyway or small town gun show. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg instead demands strict registration of law-abiding gun buyers, b oiving the federal government the name and address, type of gun and serial number ---not of criminals but of Americans deemed NOT to be criminals by the instant check!



We think it 's reasonable to provide full funding for the National Instant Check System so it

operates efficiently and instantly. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg authorizes an unlimited gun tax on purchases by law-abiding citizens.



We think it 's reasonable to expect our government to prosecute more than 24 hoods last year for providing guns to criminals. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg makes everyone

prosecutable if you just talk about buying or selling a gun at a gun show --even if you have no gun in your possession!



We think it 's reasonable to support the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. What 's unreasonable is letting 6,000 students caught with illegal guns at school go, prosecuting only 13 of them the past

two years.

We think it 's reasonable to demand that when a lawful gun buyer passes the criminal background check and purchases a firearm, records of that transaction be destroyed immediately. What 's unreasonable is Lautenberg 's decree that we trust government bureaucrats to compile and keep

We think it 's reasonable is to expect full enforcement of federal firearms laws by the federal government. What 's unreasonable is when the Justice Department claims that federal gun laws are

for the states to enforce! Reasonable people know that a case made in state court means plea bargains, judge shopping and no mandatory minimum sentencing. Even Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia knows this, even if the Justice Department does not. He said, quote: ""In state court, we average for these types of gun violations a 4-month prison sentence. The federal guidelines are

59 months in prison. That 's a 5 l/2 year difference. Incarcerating convicted felons in possession

of firearms for that length of time will save lives. It will save carnage. It will save people from being maimed. ""



That's why we support Project Exile --the fierce prosecution of federal gun laws that has cut crime rates overnight the few places it 's been tried. Even though this Administration resists it, we think

it's reasonable because it works.



We only support what works, and our proud list is long. From Project Exile to three-strikesyou're out, to truth in sentencin g, to ten-twenty-life, to mandatory minimums --what 's reasonable is what works; what 's unreasonable is what doesn 't work.



What's unreasonable is further erosion of privacy, further intrusion into private transactions, and further government penalizing of the law-abiding many instead of the lawbreaking few. America will not tolerate further surrender of precious freedoms in return for nothing but perceived but

fictitious promises that make none of us safer.



The Lautenberg legislation is not only unreasonable, it is unworkable . . . unacceptable . . . and to

our Founders who gave us the Second Amendment, unthinkable.

And finally --somebody's got to say this out loud: It 's reasonable for well-meaning people to convene hearings like this to find and fashion solutions. What 's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric becomes acceptable because it 's aimed at honest gun owners, as in the violent language of influential film-maker Spike Lee who last week reportedly said about NRA President Charlton Heston, quote, ""Shoot him --with a .44 caliber Bulldog. "" By his defiant silence, instead

of the quick apology most American role models would offer, he sanctions hate and bears his share

of culpability for the kind of violence this body seeks to stop.

On behalf of millions of gun owners who are NRA members, and tens of millions who are not yet, I am asking you to practice yourselves what is so readily preached to us: Be reasonable.

Alessia Cara Defends Her Best New Artist Grammy Win: 'What I've Created Is Worth Something',https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-alessia-cara-defends-best-new-artist-win/,people.com,44,1,"Alessia Cara is defending her win as the Recording Academy’s best new artist.

The 21-year-old singer, who was the only woman to take home a top award at Sunday’s 2018 Grammy Awards, posted a passionate note on Instagram Monday as online haters questioned why she won the best new artist title over “newer” artists like SZA, Khalid, Lil Uzi Vert, and Julia Michaels.

She began by explaining that she had “no control over” her win and didn’t submit herself or as to be submitted for the award knowing “there are other artists that deserve the acknowledgment.”

That said, Cara still felt happy about her nomination and win. “I am not going to be upset about something I’ve wanted since I was a kid, not to mention have worked really hard for,” she wrote. “I will not let everything I’ve worked for be diminished by people taking offense to my accomplishments and feeling the need to tell me how much I suck.”

In her acceptance speech, Cara — who many felt was snubbed for a Grammy in 2017 — urged fans to support musicians who might not be recognized at awards shows.

“There are some incredible artists out there that are making incredible music that deserve to be acknowledged that don’t always get acknowledge because of popularity contests or numbers games. And that’s kind of unfortunate,” she said. “So I just want to encourage everyone to support real music and real artists because everyone deserves the same shot.”

“I meant everything I said about everyone deserving the same shot,” she added on Instagram. “There is a big issue in the industry that perpetuates the idea that an artist’s talent and hard work should take a back seat to popularity and numbers. And I’m aware that my music wasn’t released yesterday, I’m aware that, yes, my music has become fairly popular in the last year. But I’m trying very hard to use the platform I’ve been given to talk about these things and bring light to issues that aren’t fair, all while trying to make the most of the weird, amazing success I’ve been lucky enough to have.”

Elsewhere in her note, Cara said that she’s already beat her haters to the punch when it comes to criticizing her worth as an artist.

“Here’s something fun! I’ve been thinking I suck since I was old enough to know what sucking meant. I’ve beat u to it,” she said. “And that’s why this means a lot to me. Despite my 183,625 insecurities, I’ve been shown that what I’ve created is worth something and that people actually give a s—.”

“All of the years feeling like I wasn’t good at anything or that I was naïve for dreaming about something improbable have paid off in a way that I have yet to process,” she continued. “I know it sounds cheesy and dumb but it’s the honest truth. Thanks to everyone who’s shown me kindness and support along the way. I’ll stop talking now.”

Good Girls, from creator Jenna Bans, will take over the post-Voice Monday 10 PM slot currently occupied by military drama The Brave, which will not be getting additional episodes. Per NBC, The Brave, which has been a modest but steady performer in the hour, was designed to do a 13-episode season, with a Season 2 renewal decision to be made at a later date.

Good Girls will debut Monday, February 26 at 10 PM, immediately following the spring-cycle premiere of The Voice, featuring new coach Kelly Clarkson alongside Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.

This Is How You Should *Really* Be Washing Your Face,https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/how-to/a7053/how-to-wash-your-face/,www.marieclaire.com,1,1,"Most of us assume that cleansing your face is a task so basic it can be accomplished even when you're completely exhausted or slightly tipsy—which, of course, it can. (All the snaps for you if you’ve successfully cleansed your skin before bed to avoid the terror that is waking up with last night’s mascara on.) But it turns out that there's a lot more to washing your face than soap and water, says Dr. Doris Day, NYC dermatologist and author of Forget the Facelift. ""With so many sophisticated, gentle cleansers that won't strip the skin, using the right one allows moisturizing and anti-aging products to absorb more effectively.""

Clearly, an old-school splash and scrub won't do. In order for your cleanser to truly do its thing, there’s a few guidelines that just can’t be compromised…and, in addition, myths floating around that need to be addressed.

Especially with the rise in cleanser innovations and the popularity of 15-step skincare routines, misinformation can be spread quick. Ahead, we spoke with some of the top dermatologists to set all the cleansing facts straight and share how to execute this very important step in your routine the right way. Read on for the new rules for getting your freshest face.

Myth 1: Wash and Go

It's more of a two-step process. ""Remove your makeup before you wash your face,"" says Montclair, New Jersey, derm Dr. Jeanine Downie. ""Many cleansers can't take off concealer or foundation completely, especially around the eyes and nose."" Use an oil-based cream, an emollient wipe, or a cleansing oil to dissolve stubborn sunscreen and makeup. Follow with lukewarm water and a dime-size amount of cleanser (look for the ingredients cocamidopropyl betaine or caprylic triglyceride, which are sulfate-free surfactants) on your fingers or a clean, damp washcloth.

Myth 2: Wash Twice a Day

While the jury is still out on how often to cleanse (every a.m. and p.m. or just once at night), all derms agree that over-washing can lead to irritation and a lack of moisture. ""The reality is most people apply some sort of night cream or serum; you want to make sure to get that off before applying your a.m. products. In the morning, it's beneficial to use a gentle cleanser such as Cetaphil and at night double cleanse with an oil-based cleanser before following up with a more active exfoliative wash,"" says New York City dermatologist Dendy Engelman.

The rule is to use common sense: Always wash your face after a workout to prevent breakouts, and wash excessively oily skin morning and night. For very dry or sensitive skin, stick to cleansing once daily in the evening. ""Be careful of over-washing the skin, as this can really strip the face of natural oils and natural lipids, which leads to irritation,"" says Dr. Tiffany Libby, assistant professor of dermatology at Brown University.

Myth 3: You Cleanse to Close Your Pores

Sorry, folks, but you can skip rituals like massaging your face to increase circulation or splashing with cold water to ""close"" your pores. ""Pores don't open and close,"" says Downie. In fact, extreme hot or cold can exacerbate problems like rosacea and redness. That said, mild steam can help soften hardened oil in pores, so it's never a bad idea to cleanse in the shower. And ""while it feels nice, massage doesn't do much,"" adds Downie. ""Exercise is what boosts your circulation.""

Myth 4: Buy Cleanser According to Skin Type

No matter what kind of skin you have, make sure the ingredients list doesn't contain fragrance, which can be irritating; parabens (potentially toxic preservatives); or harsh soap (it's drying). ""If a cleanser fits that bill, the formula itself [cream, lotion, foaming, etc.] is more a matter of personal preference,"" says NYC dermatologist Dr. Brad Katchen. Of course, people with dry skin may prefer formulas with added moisturizers, like glycerin or shea butter. And ""if you have oily skin, you might want a foaming wash that leaves skin feeling super clean,"" says Day. The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends avoiding alcohol in cleansers that can be abrasive to skin.

Myth 5: Grainy Scrubs Are the Best Smoothing Exfoliants

A salicylic- or glycolic-acid cleanser is gentler and more effective than grainy scrubs, and both offer anti-aging benefits and help prevent breakouts. Alternate these with your regular cleansers (start with three times a week), and adjust depending on how your skin is looking and feeling. The usage of acids on the skin can aid in unclogging the pores and minimizing their appearance. ""Gently exfoliate and smooth the texture of the skin with alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta hydroxy acid (BHA). These gentle exfoliative acids help to clear out debris and further minimize the appearance of the pore"", adds Libby.

Myth 6: Use Alcohol-Based Toner

""An alcohol-based toner strips off natural oils,"" explains Day. Not good. ""Gentle toners calm the skin and balance pH levels, but with the right cleanser, you don't really need this step."" Love the feeling of toning anyway? Other dermatologists would agree the step of applying toner is one you shouldn't skip, as it aids with allowing products to follow absorb more effectively into the layers of your skin. Choose gentle, alcohol-free toners instead.

Try These Alcohol-Free Toners

Myth 7: Use Cleansing Brushes Daily for a Healthy Glow

""A brush removes oil, dirt, and dead skin better than your hands can, and it's less aggressive than most exfoliating cleansers or scrubs,"" says Day. ""But it's not something you have to use every night, especially if you're also applying ingredients like retinoids or acids. Too much exfoliation can cause inflammation."" Basically: Use, but use sparingly. (Right now we're obsessed with Clarisonic's new acne-cleansing brush head, below.) To keep your brush bacteria-free, rinse and air-dry after use. Oh, and hey, clean freak, like you do with your Brita, replace the brush head every three months. Beware of pressing down too hard on the skin when using a facial brush.""Being too harsh with a brush can cause micro-injury and acne from the over-manipulation of the skin,"" adds Engelman.

Myth 8: Good Skincare Costs a Fortune

Save your pricier ingredients, like retinol or antioxidants, for leave-on products instead of for cleansers, which you're literally washing down the drain. ""[These ingredients are] most effective when they stay concentrated on the skin,"" says Katchen.

Let’s Not Be Civil,http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html?_r=3&src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB,www.nytimes.com,1152,1,"Last week, President Obama offered a spirited defense of his party’s values — in effect, of the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society. Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus.

That’s a bad idea. Equally important, it’s an undemocratic idea.

Let’s review the story so far.

Two weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology — a document telling America What Must Be Done.

But it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: “Where the president has failed, House Republicans will lead.” It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy.

So the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties’ priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works."
Kylie Jenner Explains How She Confused a Pig for a Chicken,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-explains-how-she-confused-a-pig-for-a-chicken-w446327/,www.usmagazine.com,0,1,"Well, that explains it. Kylie Jenner revealed in a Snapchat she shared with followers on Saturday, October 22, how she confused a pig for a chicken in a clip that went viral earlier this month.

Jenner, 19, looked calm and collected as she explained to fans why she blurted out, “Is that a chicken?” when she saw her mom, Kris Jenner, holding a baby pig wrapped in a blanket in a deleted scene from Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

“So I love chickens, and my mom asked me what I wanted for my housewarming gift, so I told her, ‘I want chickens, I want a chicken coop, I’m dying to have a chicken,’” she continued. “We had, like, over 10 conversations about it, so when I saw her downstairs, I saw something that was all wrapped up in her arms, and I was upstairs, of course I assumed that it was a f‑‑king chicken. I never asked for a pig.”

The makeup maven’s confusion led to some fans creating Vines poking fun at her mistake, including clips of pigs being called chickens, and one in which a little girl can be heard saying in video of pigs in a pen, “Look at all those chickens!”

Jenner took the joking in stride and told her followers Saturday, “But yeah, I just wanted to make the public announcement that I do know the difference between a chicken and a pig, so you guys don’t have to worry. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, then simply ignore all these Snapchats.”

Why Little Big Town Wore White Roses to the Grammys,http://tasteofcountry.com/little-big-town-2018-grammys-white-roses/,tasteofcountry.com,18,1,"Little Big Town helped raise awareness for the Time's Up campaign on Sunday (Jan. 28), with each of the group's four members wearing or holding a white rose as they walked the 2018 Grammy Awards red carpet.

They weren't alone in the effort. Many musicians decided to wear a white rose to make a stand for equal representation between sexes and for workplaces to be free of sexual harassment. Little Big Town said it was a personal choice for them, telling E! News' Giuliana Rancic that they were donning the roses for their children.

""We have children at home and we want to raise them to know that they can always speak out and take care of themselves and stick up for themselves,"" Kimberly Schlapman explains in the above clip. ""It's so important.""

Bandmate Jimi Westbrook expressed that everyone in the music community and beyond should have love and respect for their colleagues regardless of one's gender. ""We've been together for a long time and that's what our relationship is based on,"" Westbrook adds. ""Men and women: equal and respect. That's the main thing. We have to respect and love each other. That's what being a human being is about.""

Little Big Town won big during Sunday's Grammy Awards. The country quartet took home the Grammy for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the Taylor Swift-penned song ""Better Man"" and learned the exciting news moments before being interviewed by E!

""It means everything. I don't want to put too much on awards, but it really means a lot when your peers and the community recognizes your music,"" Phillip Sweet said upon learning about their honor. ""We're so happy and thankful for Taylor Swift for sending us the song 'Better Man.' It's amazing.""

Linkin Park Cancel Tour After Chester Bennington’s Death,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/linkin-park-cancel-tour-after-chester-benningtons-death-199730/,www.rollingstone.com,6,1,"Linkin Park officially canceled their upcoming tour in the wake of the death of their singer Chester Bennington.

“We are incredibly saddened to hear about the passing of Chester Bennington,” Live Nation, the tour’s promoter, said in a statement Friday. “The Linkin Park One More Light North American Tour has been canceled and refunds are available at point of purchase. Our thoughts go out to all those affected.”

The band has not released an official statement following Bennington’s death by suicide Thursday.

Linkin Park, who recently wrapped a European tour, were scheduled to begin a North American leg in support of their chart-topping new LP One More Light starting June 27th in Mansfield, Massachusetts. The North American trek was scheduled to conclude October 22nd with a concert at Los Angeles’ Staples Center.

Along the way, Linkin Park were set to perform two more dates on their co-headlining tour with Blink-182, the “Welcome to Blinkin Park” tour, on July 28th in Flushing, New York and July 30th in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Those two shows appear to remain on schedule but without Linkin Park.

On Twitter, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker paid tribute to Bennington in a pair of tweets.

According to the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office in Macon, Georgia, several cars were broken into on March 22 in the parking lot of the Marriott hotel. Shannon's Nisson Xterra was one of the cars targeted.

Pumpkin, Mama June's second youngest child, told police she had two guns stolen from her car — both were Ruger P-Series handguns. She says the firearms were located in a holster that was stashed under her seat.

Both weapons, she said, were fully loaded. For those that didn't know, Georgia is not a traditional open carry state, however it is legal to openly carry a firearm without a permit in a motor vehicle.

July 28 (UPI) -- The Los Angeles County District Attorney has declined to prosecute Gossip Girl alum Ed Westwick after several women accused him last fall of sexually assaulting them in 2014.

E! News said investigations were conducted, but two of the cases were dropped due to insufficient evidence and a third because the alleged victim was unavailable to be interviewed.

Westwick, 31, denied any wrongdoing at the time he was accused.

""The evidence was clear from the start that each of the allegations made by these three women were absolutely untrue,"" the actor's attorney Blair Berk told TMZ on Friday. ""It is a shame there are those who prejudged this case and that it took over eight months for Ed to be officially cleared of all of these charges. I hope that those who made such quick judgment here not knowing anything about the abundant evidence of innocence in this case will hesitate next time before they so publicly accuse someone who has committed no wrongdoing.""

The movie portrays Harding's rough upbringing under a domineering mother in Oregon and then the attack that made her a notorious sports figure.

The figure skater once famous for her '90s-style outfits, complete with a scrunchie, wore a floor-length gown with orange straps as she mingled with stars of the film, including Allison Janney, who plays her mother, and Sebastian Stan, who plays Gillooly.

Gillooly and bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt hired Shane Stant to hit Kerrigan in the knee with a metal baton after a practice session in 1994 in the hope of badly injuring her ahead of the Olympics. Harding went on to win the U.S. championship, but finished eighth at the Olympics in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan recovered from a bruised knee to win the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul.

Gillooly, Stant and Eckhardt all served prison time for the attack, while Harding was given three years probation. She also was banned for life by the U.S. Figure Skating Association.

Those troubles appeared to be in the distant past on Tuesday, when she received a loud ovation from the audience at the premiere at the Egyptian Theatre.

Selena Gomez’s mom ‘not happy’ with Justin Bieber reconciliation,https://globalnews.ca/news/3964966/selena-gomezs-mom-not-happy-with-justin-bieber-reconciliation/,globalnews.ca,86,1,"Send this page to someone via email

Selena Gomez’s mother, Mandy Teefey, was asked about her daughter’s rekindled romance with Justin Bieber, and she did not hold back.

Speaking with Gossip Cop, Teefey, 41, admitted that she is “not happy” that her daughter, 25, and Bieber, 23, are back together, but acknowledged that “Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy.”

Teefey also addressed her daughter’s recent kidney transplant, with the singer’s longtime friend Francia Raisa donating her kidney.

“When you are young, you feel invincible and she had to learn that she was not able to be your typical 20 year old,” Teefey said, adding that the family is “beyond blessed that we had Francia in our life,” and remarking that she’s “so proud” of her daughter’s bravery.

Teefey also denied that a rift formed between her and Gomez when she and her husband stopped managing their daughter’s career.

“Every mother and daughter has disagreements,” Teefey admitted. “We never expected to manage her, her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business. It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.”

‘Kevin Can Wait’: CBS Admits That Viewers Were Not Happy With Erinn Hayes’ Character’s Death,https://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/kevin-can-wait-erinn-hayes-death-kevin-james-cbs-1201965247/,www.indiewire.com,4,1,"A year ago, Kevin James told a reporter that his CBS sitcom, “Kevin Can Wait,” had killed off Erinn Hayes‘ character on the show in order to give the show a longer life. Last week, CBS canceled the sitcom after two seasons.

On Wednesday, CBS execs admitted that the choice to make James’ character a widower didn’t go over well with viewers. “Creatively, the show made a choice at the beginning of last year,” said CBS Entertainment senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. “We agreed to go along with it and unfortunately the audience didn’t respond to it.”

CBS first revealed the storyline last summer during the Television Critics Association press tour, after the choice was made to bring James’ “The King of Queens” co-star, Leah Remini, on “Kevin Can Wait” full time.

As part of a massive shift when “Kevin Can Wait” returned for its sophomore run, about 10 months passed since Hayes’ character’s death, allowing for James’ character to have moved on.

According to James, speaking to the New York Daily News in October, the thought process behind Donna’s departure was to bring a new direction to the show, one that would allow for it to run for more seasons and be “lengthier.”

“The plot of the show didn’t have enough drive. If we got through a second season, I wouldn’t see us getting through a third one,” James said before he admitted they “were literally running out of ideas.”

James said at the time that the original idea for his character was to be portrayed as a single father, but the show later made the decision to add a wife character.

But this past season, with Hayes gone, and the well-publicized decision to have her character die, ratings dropped. “It was a strong show for us, and it had a lot of decline this year, it was headed in the wrong direction,” said CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl. “The numbers were going down. Looking forward it didn’t look like a show that could anchor a night for us.”"
Stephen Belafonte opens up about his 'dirty' and 'messy' divorce from Mel B,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6434005/Stephen-Belafonte-opens-dirty-messy-divorce-Mel-B.html,www.dailymail.co.uk,2,1,"Stephen Belafonte today breaks his silence over the bitter divorce with Spice Girl Mel B, tears down 'utterly false' accusations of domestic violence and challenges the truth behind her damning book Brutally Honest.

Branding the America's Got Talent judge a 'narcissistic liar,' he claims she systematically tried to 'annihilate' every aspect of his character with a catalog of 'horrific' lies.

Belafonte insists Mel and her legal team 'concocted' a cynical plan to drag his name through the mud in a bid to gain a 'tactical advantage' in the divorce proceedings, despite having 'zero proof.'

And he says he has been left heartbroken after losing the right to see his step-daughter Angel, 11, who he helped raise from birth, while also being upset that all his children can now read about his and Mel's 'dirty' and 'messy' divorce because of his former wife's actions.

Speaking exclusively to DailyMailTV in Beverly Hills, Belafonte, 43, said: 'It was dirty. Melanie came out of the gate with such horrific tall tales - it's probably the worst divorce that's ever played out in the media, it was very messy.

His side of the story: Stephen Belafonte has broken his silence over his very public and 'dirty' divorce from Mel B, in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV

Happier times: Belafonte and Mel B, who were married for ten years before splitting last year, have endured a messy divorce involving claims of domestic abuse, cheating, threesomes, and a bitter custody battle (pictured in 2012)

'She said horrifically bizarre things - that I beat her, I ran a pornography company, I was a sex trafficker, I beat our dog, random things to garner some attention.

'I could not stop what Melanie started. She made these allegations to get a tactical advantage. She wanted everything, all the money and full custody of Madison.

'She knows when she goes out and makes these allegations, they're going to go everywhere, she did it purposefully. She did it to try to bash me so I would have to take her deal.

'But she doesn't understand one thing about me - I could lose it all, but I'm never gonna lose my daughter. When she took her away I just had to work harder to get her back.'

Defiant Belafonte, dressed casually in ripped jeans and a white dress shirt, decided to speak out as Mel's new book Brutally Honest hit the shelves Tuesday.

The main theme of the explosive memoir is the star's roller coaster ten-year marriage with her ex.

Mel, 43, accuses Belafonte of years of emotional and physical abuse, driving her to the brink.

But Belafonte calls out the book as all 'lies' and challenges his ex to produce a single bit of evidence to prove he was violent or abusive.

He doubles down on the challenge by vowing to give his ex wife his share of their $7million marital home - IF she can produce a shred of evidence.

He references the night of December 14, 2014, days before Mel appeared at the UK X Factor grand final with what appeared to be marks or bruises on her body.

He explained: 'She has said I put her in the hospital and I beat her so bad that she was in there for six or seven days. That's an open and shut case. You show the hospital records, the judge says wow and then I am the scumbag that she says I am because she has the proof.

'But what she did was very tricky. She made all these allegations and then she won't show the hospital records.'

Belafonte has slammed the 'utterly false' accusations of domestic violence and challenges the truth behind Mel's new book Brutally Honest, due in stores Tuesday, November 27. Above she is pictured wearing a silver glittering 'I Am Not Sorry I Am Not For Sale' dress during her book launch in London

The 43-year-old claims his ex-wife 'manufactured' a whole life of abuse for 10 years with 'no proof' in order gain 'tactical advantage' in their divorce. Above she is pictured with a bandage on her face, which she initially claimed was for a scrape she suffered from a fall

Mel tweeted a photo of her injury in 2012 , but later alleged in 2017 that her scrape was from Belafonte punching her with a closed fist and pushing her down on the carpet

Belafonte said Mel's legal team fended off several exhaustive requests from his lawyers to see the records, citing HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) laws.

'The judge can't even compel her to do it,' he said. 'So what she does is makes the allegations and then pulls back.

'But I stand behind it 100 million percent. I would give my interest in the house to be sold 100 percent to Melanie - show the hospital records.'

He added firmly: 'She can't show them because Melanie went into the hospital that day (Dec 14, 2014) for a drug overdose.

'Melanie has covered up her drug addiction time and time again and throwing me under the bus is kind of the way that she's done it.'

In Brutally Honest, Mel admits to being hospitalized after overdosing on 200 aspirins in a failed suicide bid on that 2014 date.

She also admitted to abusing alcohol and cocaine, drinking heavily and snorting six or seven lines of the white powder before her X Factor appearances.

Belafonte reveals he is already planning to sue for defamation

Belafonte adds that in the book, while Mel regularly alludes to violence, she does not include details of several beatings she alleged she received from her ex in court papers during their bitter divorce last year.

In court documents filed in a bid to win a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Belafonte, Mel branded her ex a 'monster' and told a horrific story of abuse.

She claimed he tried to choke her and threw her to the ground during one rage in November, 2007, the night of her 'Dancing with the Stars' finale, she alleged Belafonte 'punched her and split her lip' after becoming jealous while she filmed a segment with Usher for the X Factor back in 2012 and in August the same year, the day after performing at the closing ceremonies for the London Olympics, she alleged Belafonte punched her with a closed fist and pushed her down on the carpet.

Her skin was burned and her face 'actually scabbed over the rug burns,' she claimed.

Yet despite this apparent 'pattern' of violence not a single one of these allegations is included in the memoir.

Belafonte says the former couple do NOT have a non-disclosure agreement -meaning there's nothing to stop Mel from telling all.

Regardless, he is already planning to sue the singer for defamation of character over many of the false claims he says she's made in the book.

'She claimed some horrific, horrific things.'

So, he says, his question to Melanie is, why didn't she include what was in her initial deposition now.

'I don't know why she's not telling the world of all the things that she filed (in her deposition). That is very confusing.'

The businessman and movie producer says the past two years have been extremely stressful.

And while he admits he feels vindicated by the courts, he is still upset he wasn't able to show the mountain of evidence he had compiled proving Mel was lying about him.

He claims to have submitted more than 3,000 exhibits of evidence to the court including text messages, emails, audio recordings and videos.

'I'm not interested in my version against her version,' he explained. 'I'm just interested in the facts presented in court, that Melanie buried.

The producer said he's been left heartbroken after losing the right to see his step-daughter Angel (right) 11, who he helped raise from birth. He fought in vain to get court-ordered step-parent visitation rights

Belafonte, pictured with step-daughter and daughter, has not seen Angel who he says he raised from birth 'until she was ripped from me with no explanation'

Belafonte took to Instagram earlier this year doting on his step-daughter Angel of who he has since lost custody

'She's manufactured this whole life of abuse for 10 years with no proof, zero proof.

'We submitted thousands of emails and text messages that contradicted everything that Melanie said, but the whole world never got to see that.'

The warring couple settled the case out of court.

Nevertheless, Belafonte claims Mel changed her story repeatedly during the court case, and the domestic violence restraining order was dismissed the day before the trial after they came to a private settlement.

According to Belafonte, she gagged their former nanny Lorraine Gilles by paying her off.

Mel had been forced to admit she had had a five-year lesbian affair with German-born Gilles despite initially telling the court it was her husband who had the affair and the pair plotted against her.

Belafonte claims Mel paid Lorraine off and settled our case a day before the trial to bury all the evidence in the deposition, 'so the world didn't get to know the real Melanie Brown.'

You're not going to scare me into a bunch of lies. There was no truth. If there was any truth to it, maybe she would have had a point, but it was 100% fabricated to gain a tactical advantage.

Belafonte admits that he was in love with Mel at the beginning of their relationship having met in 2007 and says they were best friends.

'We very much were in love, we had a lot of amazing times and for some reason, you know, she came out with all of these false allegations,' he said.

'After 10 years of our marriage, when we decided to get divorced, it was a mutual decision.

'Her drinking and cocaine use were out of control and I couldn't take it anymore.

'But we were still texting each other, we still saw each other, I was seeing the kids.'

But unbeknownst to Belafonte, Mel had other plans.

She secretly hired high-powered divorce attorneys Larry Bakman and Susan Wiesner and he claims she 'concocted' an elaborate game plan to 'annihilate' him.

He claims Mel called the ATF - Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Explosives - and alleged Belafonte was hiding guns in their home.

Speaking from Beverly Hills on day of the release of Mel's new book, Belafonte described the split as 'probably the worst divorce that's ever played out in the media'

'Melanie showed up to my house with ATF, saying that I had guns, they raided my house, they didn't find anything,' Belafonte recalls.

'My ex said she was scared that I had the guns hiding somewhere else.

'So she was able to get an immediate move out (notice) on me.'

ATF agents raided the couple's Hollywood Hills house on March 31 looking for firearms and on April 3, Mel secured a temporary restraining order and move out order against her ex, which required that Belafonte steer clear of her, her three children and their house. The restraining order was never made permanent.

Belafonte said his world suddenly crumbled around him.

He was homeless, wasn't able to see his daughters and video of federal agents swarming around him looking for his guns flashed around the world.

Things would only get worse.

'I couldn't see my daughter for eight months, my ex said that I was going to take a knife and physically stab her. I lost a lot of friendships, I lost a lot of business,' he recalls.

Belafonte said he was 'dumbfounded' by his wife's actions.

He said they had spoken to each other amicably at length about how they would split things up and share custody of the kids.

'All of our text messages and emails leading up to our separation were normal...it didn't make any sense,' he said.

'Our whole game plan was to have a very smooth transition, where we lived semi-close to each other and the kids would still come over and everything was normal.

'We agreed that we would have our lawyers talk to each other about money, we didn't argue about any of it. It's crazy, it doesn't even make sense why she did this.'

Then it dawned on him.

Belafonte claims Mel paid nanny Lorraine Gilles (center) off and settled the case a day before the trial to bury all the evidence in the deposition, 'so the world didn't get to know the real Melanie Brown'

The messy proceedings forced Mel to admit she had had a five-year lesbian affair with German-born Gilles despite initially telling the court it was her husband who had the affair and the pair plotted against her

'Melanie and her lawyers contacted me and my lawyers and said, ""listen, if you give up any financial rights and you give up any rights in Madison we'll dismiss all of the allegations,""' he claims.

'Remember, I never had a charge, I had allegations... she was going to dismiss all the allegations if I gave up my daughter and money.

'And that's never going to happen. You know, I'm a father who would take ten bullets for my daughter.

'You're not going to scare me into a bunch of lies. There was no truth. If there was any truth to it, maybe she would have had a point, but it was 100% fabricated to gain a tactical advantage.'

Belafonte's attorney Grace Jamra, of Beverly Hills family law firm Jamra & Jamra, told DailyMailTV that Mel set out to 'destroy' her client but Belafonte stood firm.

She said: 'The reality was that she tarnished his name, besmirched him, a man who stood by the principle of fighting for his child, ensuring her safety and of compromising what he otherwise would have been legally entitled to receive in funds. Stephen conceded a lot financially, not because he was guilty, but because he was sick of this and wanted it over.

'And so what she wanted to do was destroy him, for whatever reason, using her celebrity status. But the most important thing is that he could not be bought to get rid of his child and he could not be bought to cop to something he didn't do.'

You'd take a bullet for your child any day of the week, but Melanie keeps firing bullets and at the very end my daughters are going to read all of the negative things she's saying. So I had to. I was forced to come forward to talk to tell people what really happened

Belafonte admits the former couple did occasionally have blazing rows during which they called each other names, but said: 'It wasn't a one sided thing that she's made the world think, that she was just at home shuttered in the house and that I was this big bad wolf.'

He now realizes that he should have known Mel was capable of such a vicious attack.

'When she was with her first husband, (Jimmy Gulzar) she annihilated him afterwards and took complete control of Phoenix, when she was with Eddie Murphy, she got rid of Eddie Murphy and got complete custody of Angel.

'I didn't even rationalize it in our relationship that that could ever happen to me.

'And when we ended up separating, that's just what she wanted to do.

'She was going to bash me, make me give up all my parental rights and I'm not going to do that.'

Belafonte is pragmatic about the future, however.

He was awarded half of the couple's money by a judge and says he been able to see daughter Madison most of the time.

'I don't want to go tell people I'm a good guy or I'm a bad guy. I can tell you want I'm not. I'm not abusive, I'm not controlling.'

The feuding exes have been in and out of court since they first split back in March 2017. Belafonte revealed his disappointment that all his children can now read about his and Mel's 'dirty' and 'messy' divorce because of his former wife's actions

Belafonte has biological daughter Madison (center) seven, with Mel but he also raised Mel's daughter with Eddie Murphy, Angel, 11, from birth. He also has another daughter Gisele from a previous relationship

But constant attacks in the media at the hands of his ex-wife have been tough, he says: 'I'm a grown man, I don't care what people say about me.'

He does care, however, how his children are affected.

Belafonte has biological daughter Madison, seven, with Mel but he also raised Mel's daughter with Eddie Murphy, Angel, 11, from birth. He also has another daughter Gisele from a previous relationship.

'I lost my stepdaughter, who I love more than anything, that I had from a brand new baby up until she was ripped from me with no explanation.

'The last text message I ever got from her was, ""Daddy, where are you? Why won't you call me back?

'And I was never allowed to talk to her.'

Belafonte hasn't seen Angel since, despite fighting in vain to get court-ordered step-parent visitation rights.

In the first eight months after the split he was also restricted to seeing Madison twice a week on supervised visits.

'I had to sit in a room with a person that was staring at me because he was told maybe I would pull a knife out and stab my daughter,' he said.

'How would Melanie allow young, amazing women, as this Girl Power person, to be subjected to such craziness. It doesn't make any sense.'

But he now spends a lot of time with Madison and is looking forward to the future.

'I'm going to continue to be an amazing father to my daughter, I look forward to the day I can walk up to Angel and show her how hard her step-daddy fought for her.

'I am just going to go on with my life, work hard and try to forget all the negativity Melanie has created and I'm gonna fight really hard in court to have the truth come out.'

He did feel it was time to defend himself, though.

'You'd take a bullet for your child any day of the week, but Melanie keeps firing bullets and at the very end my daughters are going to read all of the negative things she's saying. So I had to. I was forced to come forward to talk to tell people what really happened.'

DailyMail.com has reached out to Mel B's reps for comment.

Despite their divorce being final in December 2017, trying to settle complicated issues between them mostly over children and money, dragged on for another nine months and the warring couple didn't settle until August this year.

Earlier this month they finally reached an agreement that brought to an end their vicious battle over money and custody of Madison.

The warring couple have been ordered to stay 200 yards away from each other.

And Mel must cough up $350,000 for Belafonte's legal fees and pay him an additional $5,000 a month in child support for Madison.

Mel is also being sued for defamation by her former nanny Lorraine Gilles after branding her in court papers a 'prostitute' and 'home-wrecker'.

The singer has lost multiple appeals and the case is expected to go ahead with the first hearing on December 4.

In Brutally Honest the former Spice Girl details how she was drinking heavily and snorting lines of cocaine in between X Factor shoots to deal with depression.

In the eye-popping book Mel also opens up about her love of sex and threesomes, her controversial relationship with Eddie Murphy, her sadness over her father's death and her fractious relationship with the Spice Girls."
"Hackers Steal Photos From Plastic Surgeon to the Stars, Claim Trove Includes Royals",https://www.thedailybeast.com/hackers-steal-photos-from-plastic-surgeon-to-the-stars-claim-they-include-royals,www.thedailybeast.com,47,1,"In one of the more sensitive data breaches in recent memory, hackers have broken into a high profile, London-based plastic surgeon, and stolen a bevy of photos, including of in-progress genitalia and breast enhancement. The hackers, known as The Dark Overlord, have traditionally tried to extort their victims, including schools, medical centres, and even a production studio linked to Netflix.

“We can confirm that the Clinic has been the victim of a cyber attack. We took measures to block the attack immediately in order to protect patient information and we informed the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation,” London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS), the victim of the hack, told The Daily Beast in a statement.

“Regrettably, following investigations by our IT experts and the police, we believe that our security was breached and that data has been stolen. We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised,” the statement continued.

LBPS, based near Marylebone, describes itself as “one of the leading plastic surgery clinics in the UK” on its website. Judging by tabloid media reports, paparazzi have spotted British celebrities attending the clinic, and UK paper The Sun reported that TV star Katie Price is an LBPS customer.

“We have TBs [terabytes] of this shit. Databases, names, everything,” a representative from The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast.

“There are some royal families in here,” the group claimed.

The clinic caters to less famous patients too, with plenty of customers praising the company on social media.

“The clinic staff treated me so so well, with a warm, caring, empathic approach that immediately eased any anxieties I was feeling at the time,” one apparent customer recently wrote on Facebook.

The Dark Overlord contacted this reporter using an email account belonging to LBPS to prove they had access. The group also sent The Daily Beast a cache of photos of LBPS operations. Many are highly graphic and close-up, showing surgery on male and female genitalia. Others show apparent patients’ bodies post-operation, and some include faces.

None of a selection of tested photos returned any matches from Google reverse image searches, implying that they were indeed obtained from a private source. Several pictures include LBPS’ chief surgeon Chris Inglefield, wearing his distinctive, multi-colored head scarves. In one image, he is wearing an identical head scarf to that in an image on LBPS’ website.

As if the hack itself wasn’t enough of an issue, the hackers have threatened to distribute the stolen images.

“We're going to pitch it all up for everyone to nab. The entire patient list with corresponding photos. The world has never seen a medical dump of a plastic surgeon to such degree,” The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast last week. The images do not appear to be publicly available yet, however, and it’s unclear whether the group will follow through on their threat.

“This blokes balls were nicked mate!” the representative added, referring to a specific photo in the cache. The group often mocks or taunts its victims, both in public social media posts or during interviews with reporters.

“You’re a straight male, yeah?” they continued. “How about some actual real vaginas,” they said, before sending this reporter several sets of graphic photos. LBPS confirmed the data breach after The Daily Beast provided a number of the clinic’s photos to representatives.

After the publication of this article, a Metropolitan Police Service spokesperson told The Daily Beast, ""On Tuesday, 17 October the Metropolitan Police Service was informed of a data theft from a cosmetic surgery clinic in London. Detectives from the Met's Organised Crime Command are investigating. There have been no arrests and enquires are ongoing.""

The Dark Overlord first emerged in mid-2016, when they hacked a myriad of medical centers across the U.S., then moved onto commercial businesses and most recently schools. Earlier this month, The Daily Beast reported the group sent a flurry of death threats to students of an Iowa school district. Education officials closed a number of schools in response.

Usually, The Dark Overlord will hack a victim, steal their data, and then demand a ransom payment in exchange for not publicly releasing the, often sensitive, information. When that doesn’t work, the group may approach journalists in the hope that media coverage will put more pressure onto the target. LBPS’ statement did not explicitly mention an extortion attempt.

In all, The Dark Overlord has hacked well over a dozen targets, mostly, it appears, in the U.S., but some overseas. Senator Steve Daines recently raised concerns about the group with FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Flathead Beacon previously reported.

“We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients,” the LBPS statement continued.

""Security and patient confidentiality has always been of the utmost importance to us. We invest in market-leading technology to keep our data secure and our systems are updated daily. We are deeply saddened that our security has been breached. We are profoundly sorry for any distress this data breach may cause our patients and our team are available around the clock to speak to anyone who has any concerns by calling 0203 858 0664,” it concluded.

This story has been updated to include comment from a Metropolitan Police Service spokesperson."
'Bachelor Winter Games' Adds Bibiana & Lauren G. To The Cast & The Promo Is Already A Lot — VIDEO,https://www.bustle.com/p/bachelor-winter-games-adds-bibiana-lauren-g-to-the-cast-the-promo-is-already-a-lot-video-7914980,www.bustle.com,16,1,"If you were heartbroken by Monday night's Bachelor (producer: Fallon Jethroe) elimination, you don't need to mourn for too long. ABC has just announced that two ladies from the current season who were, as you might say, ""gone too soon,"" will be on Bachelor Winter Games (supervising producer: Lindsay Liles), which airs in Feb. Yes, that's right: Bibiana and Lauren G. have joined the Winter Games cast, which already has a stacked list of Bachelor Nation members. While the whole cast of the Olympics-inspired new show offers reason enough for excitement, the truth is, Bibiana's return to Bachelor Nation might be the most exciting news of all.

Her run on Season 22 was short — she only lasted three episodes — but impactful. In the third episode, Bibiana made a compelling case for why she should remain on TV. Even though Arie eliminated her, she tried to maneuver a one-on-one date with her love interest, which didn't quite go as planned. After setting up a couch and telescope outside in the driveway — the most romantic gesture ever, probably — the ""love trap,"" as you might call it, ended up hosting a romantic moment between Arie and Lauren B. INSTEAD. When Bibiana tried to break up their date at the spot she set up, Arie asked her for five more minutes with Lauren B. Ouch.

After her elimination, Bibiana tearfully said that she wants ""everyone to know"" that she tried. Watching her do so, and cry the whole time while doing it, was highly entertaining for Bachelor fans. As a promo clip for Winter Games suggests, the new show will likely present more of the same — which is exactly what everyone wants.

As mentioned before, Bibiana won't be the only Season 22 contestant to return for Winter Games. Lauren G., who was eliminated at the end of the second episode, will also return. While Lauren G. didn't quite make as great of an impact as Bibi, her time on The Bachelor was undoubtedly cut too short. She didn't stand much of a chance, what with so many ""Laurens"" competing for Arie's affection. The fact that she'll get to have another chance at friendly competition is a reason for celebration. And the Winter Games competition already sounds pretty intense.

The new Bachelor spin-off, which will premiere on Feb. 13 has a loaded cast from all over the world. Yes, in the spirit of the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Bachelor's new show includes cast members both from the U.S. and other countries' Bachelor seasons. As for the U.S. contestants, fan-favorites like Ashley Iaconetti and Dean ""Deanie Baby"" Unglert will get another chance at love, all while competing in athletic challenges. It's gonna be intense.

As for the international contestants, Winter Games will host Ally Thompson of The Bachelor New Zealand, Nastassia Yaramchuk from Sweden, Japan's Yuki Kimura, Christian Rauch representing Switzerland and Germany, and many more. If you're not familiar with any of these people, fear not, as you'll probably soon know everything about them, from their athletic abilities to their hot-tub temperature preferences.

The Bachelor Winter Games promises to turn up the heat during the coldest months of the year, and it's probably going to be as thrilling, if not more, than the real Olympics. If there's anything that Bachelor Nation has taught everyone, it's that love is a game and the competition is fierce. Even though Bibiana and Lauren G. didn't have much luck with Arie, at least they get another shot at love and victory. And they'll have plenty more opportunity to cry on camera, which Bibiana will most definitely take advantage of. What a time to be alive."

Previously, Summers won Miss Nebraska USA 2018 and went on to become the first woman from Nebraska to win the Miss USA title.

Early life and education [ edit ]

Summers was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in Papillion in the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area.[1] At four years old, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).[2]

She graduated from Papillion-La Vista South High School, in 2013 and later earned two degrees cum laude from Texas Christian University in 2017 child development and strategic communication, with a minor in business. While a student, she also joined the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority.[3][4] Summers worked as a certified child life specialist prior to becoming Miss USA.[5][6][7]

Career [ edit ]

2004–2019: Pageantry [ edit ]

Summers (far left) and other Miss Teen USA 2012 state titleholders at Miss USA 2012 in Las Vegas

Summers began her pageantry career at age ten, having convinced her parents to allow her to compete in pageants when they received a postcard advertisement for a local child beauty pageant.[8][9] After four years of competing, she won the title of National American Miss Nebraska Junior Teen 2009 and represented Nebraska at the national pageant and was crowned the 2009–2010 National American Miss Junior Teen. In 2012, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012. She represented Nebraska at Miss Teen USA 2012 at Atlantis Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas, but was unplaced.[10] At the end of her reign, she crowned Jasmine Fuelberth as her successor.[11] After a hiatus, Summers returned to pageantry and competed in Miss Nebraska USA 2016.[citation needed]

How Much Does Rachel Lindsay's Engagement Ring Cost? 'The Bachelorette' Spares No Expense For True Love,https://www.romper.com/p/how-much-does-rachel-lindsays-engagement-ring-cost-the-bachelorette-spares-no-expense-for-true-love-74430,www.romper.com,109,1,"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?

ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.

According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.

Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.

Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.

Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband."
This Photo Of Kanye West Kissing Saint Chicago Captures The Sweetest Father-Daughter Moment,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/this-photo-of-kanye-west-kissing-saint-chicago-captures-the-sweetest-father-daughter-moment-13140937,www.elitedaily.com,1,1,"I have been in desperate need of some lighthearted, uplifting news recently. I mean really fluffy stuff — puppies learning how to walk, epic marriage proposals, and literally anything to do with babies. Fortunately, I have a celebrity family who truly understands my needs and is here to deliver. I'm talking about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and their adorable little family, obvi! Every now and then, they take to social media to show us photos or videos of their growing family and, for that, I am eternally grateful. And now, the world is #blessed with a photo of Kanye West kissing Chicago, and it is exactly what I needed to elevate my mood today.

Kanye West has definitely been stirring the pot recently with... well, pretty much everything. But the one thing that has always remained constant is how much he clearly adores his children. And on Tuesday, Nov. 13, Kim Kardashian shared the sweetest photo of the ""Lift Yourself"" rapper giving their 9-month-old daughter, Chicago, a kiss on Instagram.

Captioning it with a simple happy face emoji, the photo shows Kardashian's rapper husband giving Chicago a kiss on the top of her tiny lil' head. Chicago, who's wearing a white tee (perhaps to match her dad) and a grey bib is giving her best ""stare off into the distance"" look, and to say that it's too pure for words is an understatement:

CAN YOU EVEN TAKE THE CUTENESS?

I can't choose which photo is cuter: Chicago and Kanye West having a precious moment together, or the photo that Kim Kardashian posted of her with her three children, North, Saint, and Chicago (or Chi, if you're trying to feel ~in the know~ with things).

Just a few days ago, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star posted the picture to Instagram, showing herself smizing with Chicago on her lap staring directly into the camera like the perfect little model. Saint is sitting (laying?) next to her giving the camera his very best profile, and North is sitting down on Kim's other side, looking like she has better things to be doing than posing for a picture. Kardashian aptly captioned the photo, ""North is always a mood 😂,"" and I've never heard a more accurate statement.

It was nice to see some sort of update with Kanye West, though, even if it wasn't regarding his new music. In case you missed it, West pushed back his Yandhi album release date once more, after initially delaying the Sept. 29 debut to Nov. 23. If you're looking to find when exactly his new album will be released, you're going to be pretty disappointed. West has yet to confirm when exactly Yandhi will drop, and on Monday, Nov. 12, he took to Twitter to open up to his fans about his new music.

After his performance with rapper Kid Cudi at Camp Flog Gnaw, West explained that he's holding off on debuting his new album because it's not quite ready yet.

He wrote,

It felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi. After performing again, I realize the new album I’ve been working on isn’t ready yet. I’ll announce the release date once it’s done. Thank you for understanding

Well, if I can't get new Kanye West music, I will absolutely settle for more Kanye West family photos, so keep 'em coming, Kim!"
Khalid Reflects on His Five GRAMMY Nominations (Exclusive),https://www.etonline.com/khalid-reflects-his-five-grammy-nominations-exclusive-92868,www.etonline.com,15,1,"2017 has been quite a year for Khalid.

The 19-year-old performer kicked things off strong in January, when his breakthrough single, “Location,” hit the Billboard R&B Top 10. Two months later, the song’s remix -- featuring Lil Wayne and Kehlani -- was released, along with his debut album, American Teen. In August, he won Best New Artist at the VMAs. By November, he was a GRAMMY nominee.

“This year has most absolutely been one big whirlwind,” the artist, born Khalid Donnel Robinson, recently told ET. “I try to take all of my experiences in and not take anything for granted. It’s really hard for me to pick and choose highlights because everything has been so incredible!”

It may be tough for him to pick a standout moment from a year that looks more like a best-of reel, but one highlight has to be the singer calling his own shot when it comes to the GRAMMYs. On the morning that nominations were announced, fans were quick to point out a 2014 tweet where a then-15-year-old Khalid declared, “I want to go to the Grammys one day.”

On Jan. 28, 2018, nearly four years to the day after sending that tweet, the singer will attend the awards ceremony as a nominee in five categories: Best New Artist; Best Urban Contemporary Album, for American Teen; Best R&B Song, for “Location” as well as Song of the Year and Best Music Video for his feature spot on Logic's ""1-800-273-8255.""

""It definitely has not sunk in yet. I don’t know if it ever will,” Khalid said of the nominations. ""This journey so far has been truly amazing, and I'm so grateful to have this platform to share my art and who I am as an individual. To be recognized and accepted by my musical peers is truly an honor.""

Judging by his Rolodex, the young star has certainly earned the recognition of his peers, even before GRAMMY nods were announced. This year alone, he’s worked with some of the music world’s biggest stars, including Lorde, Calvin Harris, Marshmello and Charli XCX. So what was his favorite musical collab of 2017?

""I'd definitely say performing a mash-up of 'Thunder' and 'Young Dumb & Broke' with Imagine Dragons at the AMAs was the coolest collaborative moment so far,” Khalid mused. “I think the performance was unexpected, but it turned out great, and it was so much fun.”

As for an artist he’s dying to work with, the performer admitted, “I’d love to collaborate with Frank Ocean. He’s one of my favorite artists of all time.”

If anyone can make a collaboration with the elusive Ocean happen, it may be Khalid, who shows no signs of slowing down after kicking his career into high-gear this year. Following the GRAMMYs ceremony, he’s headed to Europe for concert dates throughout the spring before returning stateside to kick off his North American tour, which is adorably named after his new rescue pup, Roxy. But even that's not all for him.

“I’m going to keep on writing and making new music,” he said. “I’m in the studio every chance I get and hope I can collaborate with some more of my favorite artists.”

Life on the road comes pretty naturally to Khalid, who grew up moving around the United States and even spent six years in Germany due to his mother’s career in the military. The singer has spoken in the past about how his mother, Sergeant First Class Linda Wolfe -- who sang in the Army band before retiring earlier this year after 23 years of service -- has been his biggest musical inspiration, and he can’t wait to take her with him to the GRAMMY Awards in January.

“I wouldn’t be where I am right now if it wasn’t for my mom,” he explained. “The moment is going to be unforgettable for the both of us, and I wouldn’t want anyone else by my side.”

At the ceremony, the singer and his mom will likely be sharing the red carpet with similarly-named super producer DJ Khaled, and it’s not the first time the two will be crossing paths. But, while Khalid admits that getting mixed up with the “super cool” music mogul can be frustrating at times, he’s confident about making his own name in the business: “Everyone will get the hang of it eventually!”

And even after the whirlwind success that came with 2017, when it comes to his music, he’s taking things one step at a time.

“I try not to get too ahead of myself in terms of my career and take in each moment as it comes,” Khalid reflected. “I’m just going to keep creating music, performing and connecting with my fans. I’m really excited about what the future holds and to grow as an individual and as an artist.”

The GRAMMY Awards air on CBS on Sunday, Jan. 28.

Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets but just one medal,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/22/womens-combined-lindsey-vonn-one-medal/362120002/,www.usatoday.com,76,1,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea —Twitter trolls might be the only ones excited to hear this, but it’s the truth: On the slopes, Lindsey Vonn was a bust at the 2018 Winter Olympics.



She arrived here widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, primed for a gold medal in the downhill and poised to win another medal in the Super-G.



She will head home with a measly bronze.



Before the women’s combined event Thursday, when Vonn was disqualified after missing a gate in the slalom portion of the race, she tweeted, “Man I forgot to wear deodorant today... if I hug you don’t judge me.’’



Funny, the odor after the race smelled like rationalization.



“I’ve been injured so many times that the fact I’m even here is a victory in itself,’’ Vonn, 33, told reporters after what her last race of the Pyeongchang Games and likely the final race of her Olympics career. “As a racer, as a person I have to remember that as well because I do want to win and I’m usually not satisfied with a bronze. In this situation, I think I can be very happy with what I’ve accomplished.’’

That’s Vonn’s prerogative. But no reason for anyone else to feel compelled to celebrate her Olympic performance — bronze in the downhill, sixth in the Super-G and did not finish (DNF) in the combined — with chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” Although her injuries are undeniable, she was healthy enough to have won the last two World Cup downhill races before the Olympics and even her own father, Alan Kildow, sounded underwhelmed with the bronze medal.



“It’s great skiing, but it reminds me of something that Buddy Werner used to say,’’ Kildow told USA TODAY Sports, referring the U.S. Alpine skier who raced in the 1950s and 1960s. “He said there’s two places in the race, first and last, and I only want one of them.’’

This is almost without a doubt her final Olympics; she has basically said that herself. She will stay on the World Cup circuit for a while. She needs six World Cup victories to pass Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86. She is a three-time Olympic medalist. And with her bronze in the downhill, the 33-year-old became the oldest skier to win a medal in an Alpine event.

Vonn won Olympic gold in the downhill at the 2010 Games and, after missing the 2014 Olympics because of a knee injury, this was a chance to gild her stellar racing career with another Olympic gold. Yet it’s fair to wonder if she was distracted.



At times, it felt as if she spent as much time on Twitter as she did on the slopes. The highlights: She tweeted about looking for a Valentine’s Date, tweeted about the Trump-loving trolls attacking her and, well, then there was that missing deodorant.



Most reporters (present company included) ate it up. And with the media, she was gracious, articulate, candid, funny and generous with her time. Too bad for Vonn there was no Olympic medal awarded for that.



It was the one gold she deserved.

Woody Allen: 'I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement',https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy,www.theguardian.com,65,1,"Woody Allen has spoken about his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that he should be “the poster boy”.

In an interview on Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, the writer-director was asked if there was any truth behind the allegation that he sexually abused his daughter, Dylan Farrow.

“Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.”

The story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.

“Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”

But the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.

“As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one – big ones, famous ones, ones starting out – have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”

In a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a “sad, sick man”.

Last month saw Allen’s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister’s story a “discredited allegation” and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of “brainwashing” and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words “beyond hurtful”.

When he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.”

Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities. The romantic comedy is yet to receive a release date."
"Chadwick Boseman most important thing Black Panther global, avengers",https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/01/chadwick-boseman-on-the-most-important-thing-about-black-panther-7598604/,metro.co.uk,63,1,"(Photo by Marvel/Disney/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock (9360960bx)

Black Panther broke all kinds of records when it swept across the world: it made over $1.3 billion (£974 million) in the global box office, had an African American director, African American writers and boasted an almost entirely black cast.

Set in Africa, the film’s soundtrack even features African American artists, including Sza and the lyrical wonderman Kendrick Lamar.

But for Chadwick Boseman, the success of the film didn’t register until he started promoting the film across the world.

In an extensive interview with Esquire, the actor admitted that he initially hadn’t been sure how the world was going to receive the film.

‘We premiered the movie in Korea, in London, after the LA premiere, we started to see how the world was going to receive it.

‘We knew that a lot of black people were excited about the movie. But I think when we started to see the response overseas, that’s when I started to go, ‘Oh, wow, this is a big deal’.

Legendary director Quentin Tarantino gushed about the film, saying it was the ‘kind of movie the whole world was waiting to see’.

Black Panther is seen as a phenomenon – a cultural benchmark – and it became the highest grossing superhero ever in the US.

For the T’Challa actor, the film’s success meant more than just numbers and records – it changed the face of blockbusters.

‘Studios will very often tell you that movies with a black lead are not going to work overseas.

‘So I think that was the thing for me – this means something everywhere in the world. I know at that point it could actually change how studios respond to our movies’.

He added: ‘You can no longer say definitively, ‘Black movies don’t work [outside of the US]’.

And for all those who are getting T’Challa and Dora Milaje withdrawal symptoms – don’t fret.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed that there will be a sequel (yes!).

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the possibility of a Black Panther 2, he said:’We absolutely will do that’.

Kendall Jenner Channels Kim Kardashian at the 2018 Met Gala,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/red-carpet-dresses/a20271696/kendall-jenner-channels-kim-kardashian-met-gala-2018/,www.harpersbazaar.com,19,1,"In a sea of rich fabrics and decadent jewels, Kendall Jenner stood out on the Met Gala red carpet in a simple, breezy white jumpsuit. The airy look was by Off-White, and the model fittingly brought designer Virgil Abloh as her date to the fashionable fête.

Her gauzy ensemble didn't quite fit with the theme for the evening (""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination""), but it did turn heads for a surprising reason: it's seriously reminiscent of the look Kim Kardashian wore to last year's event.

Both sisters rocked dreamy, cream off-the-shoulder ensembles and had their hair parted right down the middle:

Kim's dress last year, courtesy of Vivienne Westwood, was also unexpectedly simplistic for the Comme des Garçons-themed occasion. Nevertheless, she slayed—and Kendall did this year, too.

Though her look didn't immediately match the dress code, it was still chock-full of delicate details, like ruched sheer sleeves, which were connected to gloves. The extra touches also appeared in her beauty look, as Jenner appeared to be wearing extensions in an extra-long ponytail.

Some attendees wore luxe, never-ending trains on the red carpet, but Kendall didn't miss out on the fun just because she sported trousers. Even her pant legs came with little trains that cascaded (kind of) on the staircase.

The twinning moment between Kim and Kendall comes as a surprise, since it's usually Kim and Kylie whose styles are deemed similar for their body-hugging silhouettes and neutral color palettes. But this just shows how versatile the Kardashian-Jenner wardrobes can be."
"Grey's Anatomy Season 15, Episode 6 Recap: Did You Spot All Those Familiar Faces?",https://www.glamour.com/story/greys-anatomy-brought-back-familiar-faces,www.glamour.com,72,1,"After more than 300 episodes, Grey's Anatomy still has the powerful ability to make me cry out like few other shows on television can. And last night I really didn't see it coming.

The main medical case featured a girl named Flora who needs intestinal surgery, performed by the titular Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). But Grey's being Grey's, the case of the week is never just about the medicine. Meredith has also been informed by Dr. Richard Weber that her estranged father, Thatcher, has leukemia and only weeks to live. Mer struggles with whether or not to contact her father throughout the episode. During the surgery, she tells her bestie Alex Karev, ""I don’t really need to grieve him because he’s been a ghost for years.” While the surgery goes off without a hitch, the whole concept of death and grieving is way more complicated, as much as Meredith wishes it wasn't.

It also happens to be Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos—the Mexican holiday that celebrates and honors loved ones who have passed away. Flora's family has a makeshift altar with photographs of family members who have died in her hospital room, which Meredith admires with the little girl's grandmother. When Mer says she's sorry for all her loss, the grandmother replies, ""Don't be. They are here with us now."" The grandmother then gives Mer a marigold for her hair, which she says helps guide our ancestors' spirits back to us. ""The veil between our world and the spirit world is very thin,"" she explains. ""The marigolds, the photos, the mementos, they help guide them to us.""

GREY'S ANATOMY - ""Flowers Grow Out of My Grave"" Ð Meredith has a patient whose family is celebrating Day of the Dead, making the doctors remember loved ones they have lost. Richard shares unexpected news with Meredith about her father, Thatcher. Meanwhile, Teddy tries to tell Owen that she is pregnant but they get sidetracked, and Jo encourages Link to pursue one of the doctors, on ""GreyÕs Anatomy,"" THURSDAY, NOV. 1 (8:00-9:01 p.m. EDT), on The ABC Television Network.

And just like that, the ghosts of Meredith's past are right there on our television screens once more as a Spanish-language version of Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" plays in the background. We see George O'Malley in his blue scrubs calling out to his old friend. Lexie Grey is behind the admin desk as Meredith says goodbye to a nurse. Her mother, Dr. Ellis Grey, watches her leave, as Doc the dog follows her down the hallway to…Derek, who says simply, ""Hey"" before Mark Sloane also appears beside him. Ahhhhh, McDreamy and McSteamy together again. I'm not crying—you're crying."

Why Cher Took Some Time to Warm Up to Dominic Cooper,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/dominic-cooper-mamma-mia-2-interview-cher-amanda-seyfried,www.vanityfair.com,59,1,"This Friday, the most important movie of the year (it’s been empirically proven, don’t question it) hits theaters: Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the extremely sun-kissed sequel to 2008’s international smash Mamma Mia! As a member of a very stacked cast—Meryl Streep! Colin Firth! Christine Baranski! Andy Garcia! Cher!!—Dominic Cooper, playing the genial, abdominally blessed Sky, boyfriend to our charming lead Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried), has a key role. At the beginning of the sequel, Sky, on a business trip in New York, and Sophie find themselves grappling with the challenges of a (temporarily) long-distance relationship. Will Sky find his way back to her? And, more pressingly, which ABBA hit will the two sing once he does?

The Mamma Mia! franchise has also influenced Cooper’s personal life. The 40-year-old actor—who can currently be seen in the third season of AMC’s Preacher as well—dated Seyfried in real life, after meeting her on the film, and the two were together for more than three years before splitting up. (Seyfried would tell Elle in 2011 that she “got her heart broken pretty hard.”) Seyfried is now married to actor Thomas Sadoski, and the two have a young child together—but Seyfried and Cooper still maintain a good relationship, even if she has said it was a bit awkward for Sadoski that she and her real-life ex-boyfriend were going to be reuniting on set.

We spoke to Cooper earlier this week to discuss the “high-school reunion” vibe of the sequel, how he felt about working with Seyfried, if he thinks there could potentially be a third Mamma Mia! film down the road, and Cher’s first impression of him.

Vanity Fair: At the screening I went to, the crowd was audibly cheering, clapping, and singing along for most of the film. What was it like for you seeing it for the first time?

Dominic Cooper: It was very exciting for me the other day. I saw it for the first time with the audience [at the premiere], and I kind of purposely made this decision—which was to wait until that audience on the premiere night, which was at the Hammersmith Apollo. So it’s a huge, huge amount of people. I’ve always had sort of slight amounts of anticipation as to whether people would respond so well to the slightly more emotional direction of this [sequel]. And they really did. It was a really sort of slow build. And it was clever putting together the story with flashbacks, the prequel into sequel. And I think [the audience] really went with it and took to it. It’s like this tiny ember that’s slightly getting brighter and brighter—and then by the end, when Cher steps on, it’s completely illuminating.

What was it like to reconvene with everyone, 10 years later?

I think it was unlike anything I could sort of quantify. Not that I’ve ever done this—I’ve always actually avoided this, and not been able to [go]—but it was like a school reunion. Your first thought is, Oh, what fun. Excellent. All these people! Then you think, Oh, my goodness, actually, 10 years. What have I done? What have I achieved? What have they done? What’s changed in their life? What’s changed in mine? Has anything changed, or has nothing changed? Will I be embarrassed? What do I look like now? You know? All this sudden paranoia that suddenly affect us, in the most ridiculous way. And what I then realized was actually how . . . what good friends we were and what good friends we’d become in that short space of time. And actually, we hadn’t had that great deal of contact [over the past decade], but we just sort of kicked off where we left off and it didn’t matter.

We all knew we’d experienced something extraordinary the first time around, and we all knew we were privileged enough to be experiencing it again. And I think in hindsight what we’ve learned, certainly what I’ve learned, was that I don’t know whether I took seriously enough the sort of impact that the film has had. . . . People have approached me and the rest of the cast and have said, “I really want to thank you because this film came at such an important time,” or “It was the last time I saw my mother, and we spent that time watching it together.” Or, “when someone in my family was ill, it really helped them through that struggle.” And I never ever saw it as being that [10 years ago]. That’s why I think when we all met again, we could celebrate that, because of how wonderfully people had received it without judgment and without mocking. I know Pierce [Brosnan] sustained abuse for his singing, but only as a sort of fun jibe. [Laughing] It was a particularly pleasant, lovely atmosphere [filming the sequel].

Is singing something you feel comfortable doing on-screen? How did your feelings about singing change in 10 years?

I think I beat it both times. It was part of my training; I’d done it. I just didn’t have confidence in it. . . . And I was terrified the first time I read the Mamma Mia script, and I actually didn’t really want to go to the audition, but I did, because I just thought I wouldn’t get it."
Kelly Clarkson Opens Up About Her 37-Pound Weight Loss,https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a21238036/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-secret/,www.countryliving.com,85,1,"Country Living editors select each product featured. If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us?

Between coaching on The Voice, working on a brand new album (!), raising her four kids, and hosting her very own talk show, 37-year-old Kelly Clarkson certainly has her hands full. But after almost every appearance, be it on-screen or on-stage, something about the star seems to surface as a topic of conversation (aside from her killer style): Kelly's weight.

The singer has a history of promoting body positivity, and she always stuns regardless of her size. But she really has lost weight recently—37 pounds to be exact.

Lucky for everyone who's wondering how she did it, Kelly isn't one to hold back details about her personal life. Here's everything you need to know about her weight loss, workout philosophy, and the diet that works best for her.

Does Kelly work out?

No! Although she has shed a significant number of pounds, Kelly claims it's not from exercise.

""I'm not working out!"" the star said in a red carpet interview with Extra. ""I think people think I'm working out and I'm like, 'Don't think I'm going to come play some sport!'""



In fact, she's not a fan of exercising at all.

""This just in.... I still hate working out. I’m sweaty, red, and not any thinner . . . people say it’s good for your heart.... but people also say red wine is good for your heart,"" Kelly admitted on Twitter. ""I mean, I’m just stating facts here people. Who am I to ignore science?! #cardioversuswine.""

So...how did Kelly lose weight?

The American Idol alum first revealed her weight loss secret at the 2018 CMT Awards and during an interview on Today.





""I had an autoimmune disease and a thyroid problem that started in 2006,"" Kelly explained to Hoda Kotb. ""I read this book, it's called [by Steven R. Gundry, MD], and it might not work for you but it worked wonders for me.""

""I'm, like, 37 pounds lighter,"" she said.

Kelly's openness about the method that worked for her wasn't enough to stop false diet rumors from circulating—but she was quick to shut them down.

""Fake news that’s going around about me is that I’ve been taking weird pills 4 weight loss or doing weird fad diets,"" she wrote on Twitter, before confirming that these claims aren't true. ""I eat the same stuff I always have. It’s all just made w/different flours/sugars/ingredients.""

When a fan seeking weight loss advice replied asking for a ""decent plan"" that she could ""stick with,"" Kelly reiterated her success with The Plant Paradox.

""I read The Plant Paradox by Dr. Gundry,"" she explained. ""He gives you yes & no lists 2 go by & tells why you should avoid things & basically it all comes down to lectins & inflammation."" Kelly admitted that it as a ""very detailed read"" that feels like a ""science class,"" but promised that it has been helpful for her.



What does Kelly think of body shamers?

Even with her new look, Kelly is staying true to her body-positive attitude.

""For me, it wasn't really [about] the weight,"" she said on Today. ""For me it was that I'm not on my medicine anymore.""

The singer has spoken candidly about criticism she's faced for her size over the years.

""I was the biggest girl in the [American Idol cast],"" Kelly told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015. ""And I wasn't big, but people would call me big ... I've kind of always gotten that.""

But somewhere along the line, she learned to ignore it. As Kelly told the Daily Mail in 2017: ""Too skinny, too fat, too blonde—so much blah. This is who I am and I'm happy. Happy looks different on everyone."""
Jessie James Decker's Pregnancy Cravings Are All Over The Map With Baby No. 3,https://www.romper.com/p/jessie-james-deckers-pregnancy-cravings-are-all-over-the-map-with-baby-no-3-2907928,www.romper.com,0,1,"Pregnancy cravings are serious business. They will wake you up in the middle of the night, can be horridly inconvenient, and can sometimes feel impossible to actually satisfy. So, basically they're great for getting you ready for parenthood. As a soon-to-be-mom of three, singer and reality star Jessie James Decker's pregnancy cravings probably don't come as much of a surprise to her at this point. But the girl will most likely be a slave to them nonetheless.

During a recent interview with E! News, the Eric & Jessie star opened up about her third pregnancy. While she admitted that she and husband, New York Jets wide receiver Eric Decker already know the sex of baby number three (they are already proud parents to 3-year-old daughter Vivienne and 2-year-old son Eric Jr.), she's not quite ready to share the news with the public. But Decker was willing to open up about a few things, including the fact that she already has a name picked out for the baby, even though she's just four months pregnant.

Apparently it's a long standing tradition in the family to be well prepared in the name department, as she told E! News:

We knew all of our children's names long before. We've always had the same names picked out for the last four years. He and I are kinda like that. We just, we had a mental plan of what to do with the children's names whether it was a girl or a boy.

As for cravings? Decker said that her cravings have ""changed every pregnancy, so this one's even been different.""

That being said, she has had one ""consistent"" craving throughout all of her pregnancies, and Decker believes it's one most women share: ""Citrus. You just want oranges. Your want the citrus because your body is needing it and craving it,"" as she told E! News.

She and her little ones reportedly snack on ""little cuties"" together, and that's just about the most wholesome pregnancy craving ever.

While Decker also told E! News that she hasn't really been craving junk food... it seems her Instagram feed might be telling us a different story.

She captioned a photo of a super delicious looking chocolate cake on Wednesday on Instagram, ""Pregnancy got me like....even worse? I took what I didn't eat to the hotel with me for snacks later.""

Decker was apparently in New York City the next day, because on Thursday she shared a picture of herself digging into a big old slice of pizza with the caption, ""When in NYC you gotta get a slice.""

I don't see any oranges... curious.

Whatever Decker's pregnancy cravings might be (all moms know the whims of their hunger change by the minute, of course), the busy mom is still trying to make time for everyone in the household, including her husband of four years. She told Us Weekly recently that the couple schedule nights together for a little grown-up cuddle time to reconnect.

We plan these nights. I’ll send him a message and be like, ""Babe, it’s on tonight!"" Life gets really crazy with kids and schedules are hard, but couples need to be intimate. You have to find that time to connect with your partner.

Speaking of finding intimate time with her partner, Decker was very clear with E! News when the question of a possible fourth child came up during the interview.

Honestly it's just not a question. I don't want more than three. There's nothing wrong with people that have four or five kids, it's just not for us. The fact that we were teeter-tottering on two, I felt like three was probably in the cards. I needed a break. Luckily Bub is two years old, I've had a few year break from being pregnant and so now it's a good time. But there will definitely not be a fourth. We're good.

Besides, who knows what sort of cravings she might have if she gets pregnant a fourth time, right?

Oscar Isaac on the ‘Pain’ of Losing Carrie Fisher and Anti-Latino Hysteria in the Age of Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com/oscar-isaac-on-the-pain-of-losing-carrie-fisher-and-anti-latino-hysteria-in-the-age-of-trump,www.thedailybeast.com,57,1,"Oscar Isaac in the role of painter Paul Gauguin is trouble you see coming from a mile away—the kind you live to regret falling for anyway.

He’s a holier-than-thou painting bro with a “slightly misanthropic” streak (Isaac’s generous wording), eyes glinting with disgust in his first close-up. Pipe in one hand, book in another, dressed all black save for an elegant red scarf, he slams a table and shames the Impressionists gathered around him: “They call themselves artists but behave like bureaucrats,” he huffs after a theatrical exit. “Each of them is a little tyrant.”

From a few tables away, another painter, Vincent van Gogh, watches in awe. He runs into the street after Gauguin like a puppy dog.

Within a year, a reluctant Gauguin would move in with van Gogh in a small town in the south of France, in the hope of fostering an artists’ retreat away from stifling Paris. Eight emotionally turbulent weeks later, van Gogh would lop off his left ear with a razor, distraught that his dearest friend planned to leave him for good. He enclosed the bloody cartilage in wrapping marked “remember me,” intending to have it delivered to Gauguin by a frightened brothel madam as a bizarre mea culpa. The two never spoke again.

Or so the last two years of Vincent van Gogh’s life unspool in Julian Schnabel’s At Eternity’s Gate, itself a kind of lush, post-Impressionistic memoir of the Dutchman’s tormented time in Arles, France. (Not to mention artistically fruitful time: Van Gogh churned out 200 paintings and 100 watercolors and sketches before the ear fiasco landed him in an insane asylum.)

Isaac plays Gauguin like an irresistibly bad boyfriend, a bemused air of condescension at times wafting straight into the audience: “Why’re you being so dramatic?” he scoffs directly into the camera, inflicting a first-person sensation of van Gogh’s insult and pain.

Yet in the painter’s artistic restlessness, Isaac, 39, sees himself: “That desire to want to do something new, to want to push the boundaries, to not just settle for the same old thing and get so caught up with the minutia of what everyone thinks is fashionable in the moment.” He talks about “staying true to your own idea of what’s great.” He talks about “finding something honest.”

From another actor, the sentiment might border on banal. But Oscar Isaac—Guatemalan-born, Juilliard-trained and, in his four years since breaking through as film’s most promising new leading man, christened superlatives from “this generation’s Al Pacino” to the “best dang actor of his generation”—might really have reason to mean what he says. He’s crawling out the other end of a life-altering two years, one that’s encompassed personal highs, like getting married and becoming a father, and an acutely painful low: losing a parent.

He basked in another Star Wars premiere, mined Hamlet for every dimension of human experience, and weathered the worst notices of his career with Life Itself. Through it all, he says, he’s spent a lot of time in his head—reevaluating who he is, what he wants, and what matters most.

Right now, he’s aiming for a year-long break from work, his first in a decade, after wrapping next December’s Star Wars: Episode IX. “I’m excited to, like Gauguin, kind of step away from the whole thing for a bit and focus on things that are a bit more real and that matter to me,” he says.

Until then, he’s just trying “to keep moving forward as positively as I can,” easing into an altered reality. “You’re just never the same,” he says quietly. “On a cellular level, you’re a completely different person.”

When we talk, Isaac is in New York for one day to promote and attend the New York Film Festival premiere of At Eternity’s Gate. Then it’s back on a plane to London, where Pinewood Studios and Star Wars await.

Episode IX, the last of Disney’s new Skywalker trilogy, will see Isaac reprise the role of dashing Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whose close relationship with Carrie Fisher’s General Leia evokes joy but also melancholy after Fisher’s untimely passing.

Each film was planned in part as a celebration and send-off to each of the original trilogy’s most beloved heroes: in The Force Awakens, Han Solo (Harrison Ford); in The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); Fisher, meanwhile, had hoped to save Leia’s spotlight for last but passed unexpectedly long before filming began. Director J.J. Abrams, returning to close the trilogy he opened with Episode VII, has since said that unseen footage of Fisher from that previous film will ensure the General appears, however briefly.

For his part, Isaac promises the still-untitled ninth film will pay appropriate homage to Leia—and to Fisher’s sense of fun. “The story deals with that quite a bit,” he says. “It’s a strange thing to be on the set and to be speaking of Leia and having Carrie not be around. There’s definitely some pain in that.” Still, he says, compared to the first two installments, “there’s a looseness and an energy to the way that we’re shooting this that feels very different.”

“It’s been really fun being back with J.J., with all of us working in a really close way. I just feel like there’s an element of almost senioritis, you know?” he laughs. “Since everything just feels way looser and people aren’t taking it quite as seriously, but still just having a lot of fun. I think that that energy is gonna translate to a really great movie.”

Fisher’s absence is felt keenly on set, Isaac says. As if to reassure us both, however, he reiterates: “It deals with the amazing character that Carrie created in a really beautiful way.”

Two months after Fisher’s death, Isaac’s mother, Eugenia, passed away after an illness. A month after that, the actor married his girlfriend, the Danish documentarian Elvira Lind. Another month later, the couple welcomed their first son, named Eugene to honor the little boy’s grandmother. Work offered a way for a reeling Isaac to process.

There was his earth-shaking run at Hamlet, in which Isaac starred as the titular prince in mourning at New York’s Public Theater. And then there was writer-director Dan Fogelman’s Life Itself, a film met with reviews that near-unanimously recoiled from its “cheesy,” “overwrought” structure, filled with what one critic called the genuine emotion of “a damage-control ExxonMobil commercial.”

The reaction surprised Isaac. “I thought it was some of my strongest work,” he says. “Especially at that moment in my life. This guy is dealing with grief and, for me, it was a really honest way of trying to understand those emotions and to create a character who was also going through just incomprehensible grief.” He’s proud of the performance—and, in a strange way, heartened by the sour critical response.

“To be honest,” he says brightly, “there was something really comforting about it.” That the work “for me, meant something and for others, didn’t at all, it just made the whole thing not matter so much in a great way.”

“I was able to explore something and come out the other end and feel like I grew as an actor,” he explains. “That matters to me a lot. And the response to that, you know, it’s interesting of course, but it was a great example for me of how it really doesn’t dictate how I then feel about what I did.”

He thinks for a moment of performances and projects that, conversely, embarrassed him—ones that to his shock, boasted “really great notices” in the end. “You just never know, you know? It’s completely out of my control.”

Isaac is an encouraging listener in conversation, doling out interested yeahs and uh-huhs, and often warm, self-deprecating laughter. When I broach a particularly personal subject, he seems to sit up—somehow, suddenly more present. It’s about his last name.

Óscar Isaac Hernández Estrada dropped both surnames before enrolling at Juilliard in 2001. He’d run into several Óscar Hernándezes at auditions by that point, and taken note of the stereotypes casting directors seemed to have in mind for them—gangsters, drug dealers, and the like. So he made a change, not unlike many actors do.

“ I think for a lot of immigrants, the idea is that you don’t always just want to be thought of as other. ”

Whether Óscar Hernández might have had a crack at the astonishingly diverse roles Oscar Isaac has inhabited, we’ll never know. But given Hollywood’s limiting tendencies, it is less likely he’d have played an English king for Ridley Scott in 2010’s Robin Hood, four years before his breakthrough role as a cantankerous folk singer in Joel and Ethan Coen’s Inside Llewyn Davis. He was an Armenian genocide survivor in last year’s The Promise, an Israeli secret agent in August’s Operation Finale, and now, he’s the Frenchman Paul Gauguin.

Star Wars’ Poe Dameron, meanwhile, or the mysterious tech billionaire in Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, or the army commando in his second Garland mind-twist, Annihilation, specify no ethnicities at all. It’s the dream: to be hailed as a great actor, period. Not a “great Latino actor” first. To be seen for your talent, and as “other” rarely at all.

There’s a crawl space between those distinctions, though, where another anxiety lives. The one that makes you wonder: Am I “representing” as loudly as I should? Am I obliged to at all? If I don’t, what does that make me? Isaac listens attentively. Then for several unbroken minutes, talks it out with himself.

He rewinds to yesterday, when he boarded a plane from London on which an air steward addressed him repeatedly as “señor,” unbidden. “It was just a little weird. So I started calling him ‘señor’ as well. I was like, thank you, señor!” Isaac recalls, cracking up. “But then at the same time, I had that thought. I was like, but no, I should really, you know, be proud of being a señor, I guess?”

“I think for a lot of immigrants, the idea is that you don’t always just want to be thought of as other. Like, I don’t want him to be just calling me ‘señor.’ Why?” he asks, more of the steward than himself. “Because I look like I do, so I’m not a mystery anymore? It did bring up all those kinds of questions.”

He grew up in the United States, he explains; his family came over from Guatemala City when Isaac was 5 months old. “I’m most definitely Latino. That’s who I am. But at the same time, for an actor it’s like, I want to be hired not because of what I can represent, but because of what I can create, how I can transform, and the power of what I create.”

Still, Isaac exists in the year 2018 with the rest of us. “I’m not an idiot,” he adds. “And I know that we live in a politically charged time. There’s so much terrible language, particularly right now, being used against Latinos as a kind of political weapon.” He recognizes, too, the necessity “for people to see people that look like them, because that’s a very inspiring thing.”

As a kid, Isaac looked up to Raúl Juliá, the Puerto Rican-born actor and Broadway star whose breakthrough movie role came as Gomez Addams of the ’90s Addams Family films. “But I looked up to him particularly because he was a Latino that wasn’t being pigeonholed just in Latino parts,” Isaac adds.

“I do think there is a separation between the artist and the art form, between a craftsperson and the craft.” For himself, he calls it “that double thing,” as apt a term as any for that peculiar tension: “Like yes, I am who I am, I came from where I come from. But my interest isn’t just in showing people stuff about myself, because I don’t find me to be all that interesting.”

“What is more interesting to me is the work that I’m able to do, and all that time that I spent learning how to do Shakespeare and how to break down plays and try to create a character and do accents,” he says. “That, for me, is what’s fun.”

But it’s always that “double thing”—reconciling two pulls and finding a way not to get torn up. He wants American Latinos “to know, to be proud that there is someone from there that is out and doing work and being recognized not just for being a Latino that’s been able to do that.” On the other hand, he’s “just like any artist who’s out there doing something. I feel like that’s…” He pauses. “That’s also something to be proud of, you know?”

Isaac’s focus lands on me again. “And I think for you too, you’re a writer and that’s what you do. You’re a journalist. Your identity is also part of that, but I think that you want the work to stand on its own, too.”

His older sister, Nicole, is “an incredible scientist. She’s at the forefront of climate change and particularly how it affects Latino communities and low-income areas. And she is a Latina scientist, but she’s a scientist, you know? She’s a great scientist without the qualifier of where she’s from. And that’s also very important.”

Paul Gauguin’s life after van Gogh’s death by gunshot at 37 revealed more repugnant depths than his dick-ish insensitivity.

He defected from Paris again, this time to the South Pacific, determined to break from the staid art scene once and for all. He “married” three adolescent brides, two of them 14 years old and the other 13, infecting each girl with syphilis and settling into a private compound he dubbed Maison de Jouir, or “House of Orgasms.” “Pretty gnarly, nasty stuff,” Isaac concedes, though he withholds judgment of the man in his performance onscreen.

To do so might have made his Gauguin—alluring, haughty, insufferable, brilliant—“not quite as complex.” Opposite Willem Dafoe’s divinely wounded depiction of van Gogh, however, he found room to play. “It was interesting to ask, well, what’s the kind of person that would feel that he’s entitled to do those kinds of things?” The man onscreen is an asshole, to be sure, but hardly paints the word “sociopath” onto a canvas. He’s simply human: “I think that anyone has at least the capacity to do” what Gauguin did, Isaac reasons.

The actor has had more than one reason to think on a person’s capacity to do terrible things in the last year. Two men he’s worked with—his Show Me a Hero director, Paul Haggis, and X-Men: Apocalypse helmer Bryan Singer—were both accused of sexual assault in the last year, part of a torrent of unmasked misconduct Hollywood’s Me Too movement brought to national attention.

“It’s a tricky thing,” Isaac says, “because you get offered jobs all the time and, I guess, what’s required now? What kind of background checks can someone do beforehand? There isn’t a ton.” (Just ask Olivia Munn.) “Especially as an actor, to make sure that the people you’re working with, surrounding yourself with, haven’t done something in their past that I guess will make you seem somehow like you’re propping up bad behavior.”

Carefully, he expresses reservations about the phenomenon of the last year. “People don’t feel like they’re getting justice through any kind of legal system, so they take it to the streets,” he ventures. “It’s basically street justice. You have no other option. And what happens when you take it to the streets is that damage occurs, and sometimes people get taken down, things get destroyed that you feel like maybe shouldn’t have.”

“But some of it had to happen, and hopefully now there’ll be more of a system in place to take these things seriously,” he says. “It seems like it is starting to happen more, but then you see things like, how can this person get away with it? How can that person? It just boggles the mind.”

He pulls back again, remembering what’s out of his control.

Tomorrow, he’ll be back in an X-Wing suit, as Poe struggles to accept the same truth. In a year, he’ll be home in New York with his wife and young son, focusing on matters more “real” than Hollywood, its artists, and its art. Whatever he chooses whenever he returns, he’ll be ready—for the critics, the questions, for this new reality.

“All I can do is just do what means something to me,” he says. “You just have to find something honest.” One expects he will."
Kim Kardashian West Wears Cargo Pants and Yeezy Heels in Los Angeles,https://www.vogue.com/article/kim-kardashian-west-cargo-pants-los-angeles,www.vogue.com,49,1,"Cargo pants get a bad rap. A favorite of suburban dads everywhere, the divisive trousers are hard to pull off, though that doesn’t stop celebrities from trying. The latest to offer an elevated take on the look is Kim Kardashian West, a reality star who has made a habit of fearlessly test-driving new trends. Out for dinner last night in Hollywood after heading to the polls, Kardashian West wore an unexpected suit consisting of a cream blazer, asymmetrical neon bodysuit, and white cargo pants complete with drawstrings at the waist and ankles.

On anyone else the combination might not have worked, but Kardashian West tailored each piece to her petite frame for maximum effect while playing with proportions. The oversize jacket offset the curve-hugging bodysuit, and the cargo pants pulled everything together for a fresh take on business casual. A pair of transparent Yeezy pumps provided the dramatic final touch—heels worthy of a woman used to making power moves."

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's $18 Million Former Bel Air Mansion is Already Back on the Market,https://people.com/home/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-18-million-former-bel-air-mansion-is-already-back-on-the-market/,people.com,29,1,"Update: On Oct. 19, the L.A. Times reported the house sold outside the Multiple Listing Service for $14 million.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Bel Air home is back on the market, just seven months after they sold it for $17.8 million

The couple let go of their former estate in November, handing over the keys to Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, who seemed smitten with the property after receiving a personal tour from Kardashian.

Her real estate dreams weren't meant to last, however, as she's now relisted the property for $18 million with Million Dollar Listing's Josh and Matt Altman, the brothers confirm to PEOPLE.

Acton told TMZ that she's selling because she's expecting a baby girl and plans to move to a new home with a guest house, where her parents can live. She's reportedly also relocating to the Miami area, where she'll look for an even larger house with about 10,000 additional square feet. (Kardashian and West's former home is 9,000 square feet.)

The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman

The Altman Brothers were the listing agents on the property for the previous sale as well, which the couple sold for more than one-and-a-half times the price they originally paid for it — making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bel-Air Crest, according to the MLS.

Kardashian, 37, and West, 41, originally picked up the place in January 2013 for $11 million and did extensive renovations on it throughout the years.

""When they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,"" Josh exclusively told PEOPLE at the time of the sale. ""Now, it's been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful.""

The six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home features large automatic windows, a pool, and breathtaking views of L.A.

Kardashian, West and their three children — North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months — now reside in Hidden Hills, California, where they picked up a new mansion for a reported $20 million in 2014. Kardashian told PEOPLE at the time that she and her husband had ""just found a new, amazing place"" nearer to her mom, Kris Jenner.

""When we bought our Bel Air house, we didn't have a baby, we weren't even pregnant,"" Kardashian explained of the decision to find a new, larger home. The couple reportedly never lived in the completely overhauled home.

""After you have a baby, you realize that you need so many other things and a different kind of space,"" she said. ""So being in the city is a different life. We wanted to be away and have more privacy.""

They moved into the Hidden Hills house in December 2017, despite ongoing renovations, in order to get settled before baby Chicago's arrival, a source confirmed to PEOPLE.

The new estate boasts 3.5 acres, two swimming pools, two spas and its own vineyard. They made significant changes to this property as well, and Jenner recently stated that the house is now worth $60 million."

Avengers: Endgame could turn Ant-Man into one of its most important superheroes,https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18130501/avengers-endgame-trailer-explained-ant-man-scott-lang-quantum-realm-infinity-war,www.theverge.com,7,1,"By the time Avengers: Endgame comes out, there will be 22 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you’ve skipped one or two, there may be some lingering questions after watching Endgame’s first trailer.

Avengers: Endgame’s trailer sets up a surprising reveal: the surviving Avengers presumed that Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, was killed when Thanos wiped out half of the universe’s life, only to have him turn up on their doorstep at the end of the trailer. Lang’s appearance — wildly waving his arms around and asking Captain America to let him into the makeshift Avengers headquarters — is to the great surprise of just about everyone.

Ant-Man didn’t appear in Avengers: Infinity War, which could explain why heroes like Captain America, Black Widow, and Bruce Banner (the Hulk is also MIA) are shocked to learn that Lang survived. But Lang’s appearance won’t be surprising to anyone who watched Ant-Man and the Wasp, which arrived after Avengers: Infinity War.

“We’re in the endgame now.”

A post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp explains that while other people on Earth were shattering into dust following Thanos’ snap, Ant-Man was in the quantum realm. Ant-Man may not have been killed by Thanos’ snap — officially referred to as the Decimation, according to Marvel Comics — possibly because he wasn’t within the universe at the time.

Now, and there’s still a sense of disbelief over these next few words, but Ant-Man could be key to saving the world. Doctor Strange noted in Infinity War there was only one way this could play out, and Ant-Man’s time spent in the quantum realm certainly seems like a part of that. Doctor Strange did see into the future — and he did give Thanos the Infinity Stone for a reason, saying that they were “in the endgame now.” Endgame will also likely rope in Captain Marvel and her space-traveling powers, so while everything may not rest on Ant-Man, he certainly has a bigger role than many of us may have originally thought.

There are only a few ways that Ant-Man could have escaped from the quantum realm after Hank, Janet, and Hope, who are reunited in the film, are decimated. Someone with knowledge of quantum realms, like Ava Starr / Ghost or Tony Stark (although he seems to be a bit busy being stranded in space) could potentially help with that. The Infinity Stones could reverse elements of time and space to bring Lang back, but it seems unlikely Thanos would do that.

This leaves another possibility: time vortexes. While Lang is exploring the quantum realm, he’s warned to look out for time vortexes, whose name implies that if he passes through, could reconfigure time itself. This means when Lang teams up with the Avengers — or the remaining Avengers — they could use those time vortexes to reverse time and save the population from devastation.

Now, the issue with Avengers trailers — or any movie trailer — is you can’t trust them. Remember that the Hulk starred in Avengers: Infinity War’s trailers and then never appeared in the actual film. This could just be a cool gesture to throw fans from guessing what’s going to happen — like we are — but this does help to explain how the Avengers could possibly defeat Thanos going forward.

It seems that to properly understand Avengers: Endgame, people are going to have to settle in and revisit Ant-Man and the Wasp. Who could have predicted that?

Avengers: Endgame will be released on April 26th, 2019."

Justin Theroux Cancels Late Show Appearance After Jennifer Aniston Split,https://people.com/movies/justin-theroux-pulls-out-late-show-appearance-following-jennifer-aniston-split/,people.com,57,1,"Justin Theroux seems to be laying low following his split from Jennifer Aniston.

The Leftovers actor will no longer be making a previously scheduled appearance on Tuesday’s episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, according to a new guest lineup released by the show.

Theroux was announced as Tuesday night’s guest on Valentine’s Day, but his name was absent from an updated roster released by the show on Monday.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who was slotted to appear after Theroux, has been bumped up to the evening’s first slot, and actor Chris Gethard is filling in as a second guest.

Theroux and Aniston announced their split after seven years together and two and a half years of marriage with a statement released by Aniston’s longtime publicist on Thursday: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.

“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” their statement continued. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”

A source told PEOPLE shortly before the breakup that Aniston and Theroux’s differing personalities and interests had put a strain on their marriage.

They are “very different people,” the source said.

On top of work demands keeping them apart, Aniston spent most of her time in Los Angeles with her close-knit group of friends in the months leading to their separation, while Theroux often visited New York City.

“Jennifer loves her life in Los Angeles, and if anything, she has grown more attached to being there,” said an entertainment source. “Justin is not that comfortable or happy in Los Angeles all the time. He loves New York and always has.”

Aniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008’s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 — just a few days before Theroux’s 44th birthday.

While the duo announced that they separated at the end of the last year, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family."
Emmy Awards: Thandie Newton gives emotional speech for Westworld win,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/thandie-newton-emmys-speech-full-dress-award-westworld-supporting-actress-a8542481.html,www.independent.co.uk,50,1,"Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviews Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter Email * SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice

Thandie Newton gave a moving acceptance speech after being announced as the winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress at this year's Emmy Awards.

The Westworld star prompted laughter from the audience at the Hollywood ceremony when she began with ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight"".

She told the aurdience: ""I am so blessed. I am so f***ing blessed..."" At this point the actress clapped her hand over her mouth as she realised she'd dropped the expletive – to more cheers from the audience.

""To work with the people that I have gotten to work with,"" she said. ""The cast and crew of – I can't believe I'm here – the cast and crew of Westworld, I love you all so much.""

Newton beat The Handmaid's Tale stars Ann Dowd, Yvonne Strahovski and Alexis Blediel, Game of Thrones' Lena Headey, Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things, and Vanessa Kirby from The Crown to win the award. She revealed that the day was all the more special because it was her daughter's 18th birthday.

""My family, my daughter Ripley turns 18 today and I get to guide you and love you and protect you, which is my north star, I love you so much baby,"" she said. ""Thank you, thank you for this,"" she concluded, before walking offstage with The Handmaid's Tale stars Elisabeth Moss and Samira Wiley, who had presented her with the award.

It was Newton's second nomination and her first win at the Emmys. She was previously nominated for the same role in Westworld last year.

This year's Emmy Awards were relatively uneventful, with highlights being off-script moments such as director Glenn Weiss proposing to his partner Jan Svendsen onstage.

Co-hosted by Saturday Night Live's Colin Josh and MIchael Che, the ceremony saw Game of Thrones emerge as the biggest winner on the night, while Atlanta fans were left disappointed as the acclaimed FX comedy left empty handed.

Game of Thrones' win for Outstanding Drama Series raised a few eyebrows. As Ed Powers noted for The Independent, even the show's biggest fans would admit that the seventh series was littered with flaws and lacked the gravitas of previous seasons.

What this year's Emmys did prove is how TV is rapidly changing, with its more ""obscure gems"" recognised among the traditional blockbuster winners.

Jennifer Lawrence's Dating History — and What She's Said About Romance,https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lawrence-dating-history-what-shes-said-about-romance/,people.com,35,1,"Jennifer Lawrence's love life has been as diverse as her film career.

The Oscar winner, who quickly surged to fame after playing Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games film series, has had a wide range of real-life love interests — including a famous musician, another fellow actor and Hollywood director.

However, Lawrence decided it was time to settle down after meeting art gallery director Cooke Maroney through a mutual friend in 2018, whom she called ""the greatest human being"" she'd ever met. The couple eventually tied the knot in 2019 and welcomed their first child together in April 2022.

""I just met Cooke, and I wanted to marry him,"" Lawrence said in June 2019 on Catt Sadler's podcast Naked with Catt Sadler. ""We wanted to marry each other, we wanted to commit fully.""

Though the Red Sparrow star previously joked about the lack of romance in her life — ""What dating life?"" she said in 2016 — her record of Hollywood relationships contradicts her witty remarks.

Here's a look back at Jennifer Lawrence's dating history.

Nicholas Hoult

Before everyone else, there was Hoult. While filming X-Men: First Class in 2010, Kentucky-born Lawrence began a romance with her British costar. They briefly split in 2013 before reuniting both off- and onscreen in X-Men: Days of Future Past. They ultimately ended their five-year relationship in August 2014.

In November 2015, Lawrence admitted she felt lost after she ended her romance with Hoult around the same time she filmed the last Hunger Games movie.

""I was also in a relationship with somebody for five years, and we broke up around the same time I wrapped the movies. Being 24 was this whole year of, 'Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?'"" she told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.

The two remained friendly with each other and have continued to costar together in the X-Men films Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019). In a 2019 Elle interview, Hoult described working with Lawrence as ""going back to school after the summer holidays.""

Chris Martin

Lawrence also dated Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, whom she began seeing in August 2014, five months after his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow filed for divorce. Martin and Lawrence dated for four months before they broke up for the first time in October 2014.

Then, in late December of that year, the pair were presumably back together after they were spotted on a dinner date. In January 2015, they attended Harry Styles' 21st birthday party in Los Angeles. Then they were seen enjoying a cozy weekend in New York City in April and spotted together again in May in Los Angeles.

However, in August 2015, multiple sources told PEOPLE that Lawrence and Martin split for the final time.

""Chris doesn't really want the relationship to end, but he needs to be flexible so he can see his family as much as possible with his own work schedule,"" said a Martin source. ""He's crazy about Jen but wants to keep his own schedule and be able to do what he wants when he wants to do it.""

According to a Lawrence friend, the actress got ""tired of Chris being so noncommittal.""

Darren Aronofsky

Lawrence and Aronofsky began seeing each other in September 2016, shortly after wrapping Mother! — which Aronofsky wrote and directed —and their relationship continued to blossom despite their 22-year age difference. The private couple kept mum about their romance while promoting the movie a year later and only posed together at the film's New York premiere.

The Silver Linings Playbook star was first spotted dining with the Brooklyn native in N.Y.C. in August 2016. They then spent time in Los Angeles in October, where they had an intimate dinner with her close friends at the Commissary restaurant at the Line Hotel. In November, they joined forces to encourage college students to get out and vote.

Lawrence and Aronofsky dated for a year before splitting in November 2017.

The director was previously in a nine-year relationship with actress Rachel Weisz (the two have a son) before they broke up in 2010, and Weisz moved on to marry her Dream House (2011) costar Daniel Craig in June 2011.

Cooke Maroney

Lawrence met the art gallery director in 2018 through one of her close friends, according to Page Six TV, and the couple was later seen walking around in N.Y.C. and showing PDA several times.

In August 2018, the couple enjoyed a romantic getaway to Rome and Paris and were spotted on a few N.Y.C. dates during the following months.

The artsy couple was engaged by early February 2019, and Lawrence opened up about her then-fiancé on her friend's podcast, Naked with Catt Sadler.

""He's my best friend. I want to legally bind him to me forever,"" Lawrence said. ""And, fortunately, the paperwork exists for such a thing. You find your favorite person on the planet, and you're like, 'You can't leave!'""

Lawrence and Maroney held their wedding ceremony at the opulent Belcourt of Newport mansion in Rhode Island in October 2019, just after hosting a rehearsal dinner with over 130 guests, including Adele, Amy Schumer and Kris Jenner.

After two years of marriage, the pair welcomed their first child, Cy, in February 2022 and named the newborn after one of Maroney's favorite painters, Cy Twombly. Lawrence spoke about motherhood to Vogue for their October 2022 issue, saying, ""My heart has stretched to a capacity that I didn't know about. I include my husband in that."""

Scarlett Johansson Explains Why She Wore Marchesa to the Met Gala,https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/met-gala-2018-why-did-scarlett-johansson-wear-marchesa.html,www.thecut.com,8,1,"Scarlett Johansson. Photo: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images

Scarlett Johansson made the most controversial outfit decision at last night’s Met Gala, and it didn’t even involve a Pope hat. The actress, who was accompanied by her official boyfriend Colin Jost, wore a pink-and-red tulle gown designed by Marchesa, the line founded by Harvey Weinstein’s ex-wife Georgina Chapman. This marks the first time a major celebrity has worn Marchesa to a red carpet event since the Weinstein allegations broke.

Once a red-carpet staple, Marchesa saw its popularity plummet in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, especially after stories suggested that Weinstein had pressured actresses in his films to wear his wife’s dresses. But recently Marchesa has made efforts to rehabilitate its image, with co-founder Keren Craig telling Refinery29 that the brand wants to support the #MeToo movement.

In a quote provided to the Cut, Johansson said that she wore Marchesa because she wanted to show her support for the women behind the brand. “I wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,” she said. Endorsing Chapman’s line appears to be Johansson’s tacit way of saying that women shouldn’t be penalized for the crimes of the men in their lives, something that many #MeToo supporters will likely be able to get on board with.

“We are truly honored that Scarlett chose to wear Marchesa for the Met Gala,” said Marchesa in a statement. “She is an amazingly talented actor who has incredible style and presence. It was wonderful to work so closely with her in creating this custom look.”

The Big Short actress has been hanging around Los Angeles this week, as she was seen headed toward a workout in Studio City, California on Wednesday, prior to a Mexican dinner with friends, then a trip with Bieber to Hillsong Church, the celeb-friendly placed of worship that counts Hollywood stars such as Kourtney Kardashian, Hailey Baldwin and Nick Jonas as its regular attendees.

Aside from her birthday message to Bieber, Gomez was in the news Thursday as her rumors of a feud between her and Demi Lovato - in particular over Gomez's friendship with Taylor Swift - were shot down by Demi’s mom, Dianna De La Garza.

'Demi and Selena love each other and always will love each other,' De La Garza, 55, told People Thursday. 'There’s nothing that will ever come between them.'

The two were childhood pals when working on the show Barney and Friends, De La Garza recalled.

'They started out together! We had some great times together. They will always will love each other.'

De La Garza recalled how Gomez was a regular at their home as a child.

'I Miss You So Much': Cheryl Burke Breaks Social Media Hiatus to Mourn Death of Her Father,https://people.com/tv/cheryl-burke-mourns-fathers-death-breaks-social-media-hiatus/,people.com,100,1,"Sending hugs to Cheryl Burke.

The new Dance Moms star, 33, shed light on why she was stepping away from social media on Monday when she shared that her father, Stephen Louis Burke, died earlier this month. Burke shared a throwback photo of herself as a child getting a kiss on her head from her dad.

“Dad, if I had one more chance to have you here with me today, I would do things differently,” she captioned the sweet shot on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. “Every day I would tell you how much I love you. I miss you so much already.”

The Dancing with the Stars pro added that her father passed away on March 9, nearly a month shy of his 68th birthday.

Burke told PEOPLE in 2011 that she felt “abandoned” after her parents split when she was a toddler. Her mother remarried in 1993 — and Burke forged a close bond with her stepfather Bob Wolf, whom she calls Dad.

During a 2012 appearance on Bethenny Frankel‘s talk show, the dancer said she had been estranged from her dad for a decade but reconnected after he was in a bad accident.

“I just wanted to make sure that everything in my life was okay, and I felt like there was that void in my life,” Burke explained. “I have a wonderful stepfather who has been my father, but it was really important for me just to reach out to my dad. Just for me and to like, have some closure if anything really were to happen.”

The sad announcement comes just six days after Burke told fans she would be taking a hiatus from social media because she was “dealing with some personal things right now” on March 13, only a few days after her father’s passing.

“Thanks for your understanding,” she continued, “and remember to tell the people who are important to you just how much you love them each and everyday. Xoxo Cheryl.”"

Everything Cynthia Nixon's Sex and the City Costars Have Said About Her Run for New York Governor,https://people.com/politics/cynthia-nixon-sex-and-the-city-costars-support-gubernatorial-run/,people.com,47,1,"Cynthia Nixon has enjoyed plenty of support from her friends while campaigning to become the next governor of New York!

On Thursday, New Yorkers will head to the polls to cast their vote in the state’s primary elections, as Nixon challenges incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has served two terms, for the Democratic nomination.

Nixon, 52 — who supports increased funding for New York public schools, abortion rights and the legalization of marijuana — is running on a progressive platform. If she wins the primary and then the election on Nov. 6, Nixon would be the first woman and openly gay person to hold the position.

While it’s still too soon to know the fate of Nixon’s gubernatorial run, here’s a look back at all the warm endorsements Nixon has received from her fellow Sex and the City alums.

Sarah Jessica Parker

Sarah Jessica Parker, whose friendship with Nixon predates the beloved HBO series, revealed in April that she knew about Nixon’s plans to run for office before the official announcement.

“She shared with me that she was going to announce about a month before. I was incredibly excited and proud of her. I think she’s already been good for the conversation,” Parker, 53, told a large crowd gathered for a retrospective on her career at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.

“This is what’s exciting about primaries, right? People can inspire an incumbent to reconsider policy…or just have a robust conversation,” Parker added. “She’s formidable. She’s incredibly bright. She’s really brave. She’s excited about this race, and it’s challenging. But, she seems enormously energized and I think it’s good for us to have a competitor — it’s always good. A challenger is good.”

Earlier at the event, Parker admitted that while she “didn’t [anticipate] that she would seek a gubernatorial seat,” Nixon has “been an activist her entire life.”

“She’s incredibly bright, she loves this city, she’s been involved in conversations about policies that have been really important to her for many years: Education, public schools, housing…the larger issues that are part of conversations that affect us here [in the city] and upstate as well,” she added.

Shortly after Nixon announced her candidacy, Parker also penned a sweet note on Instagram, offering her pal support.

Describing Nixon as “a mother, an activist, an advocate, a fighter, a NY’er and a dear friend,” Parker told Nixon, “My sister on and off screen, you have my love, support and vote.”

Kim Cattrall

Days after Nixon announced her candidacy in March, Kim Cattrall revealed that she supported her costar’s decision.

Responding to a Twitter user who asked for her opinions, the 61-year-old actress who played Samantha replied, “I support & respect any former colleague’s right to make their own career choices.”

Kristin Davis

Mere minutes after Nixon announced her bid, Kristin Davis was ready to offer her friend a warm endorsement.

“I am so proud of @cynthiaNixon, no one cares more than she does about EVERY person getting a fair change and a good education. I know she would be an excellent Governor !” wrote Davis, 53, who played Charlotte on the hit HBO series.

Davis then shared that she had already donated to Nixon’s campaign, and urged her followers to do the same.

“I’m excited to support someone I have know [sic] for 20 years to be one of the most intelligent and caring people in my life,” Davis added.

Willie Garson

Support for Nixon wasn’t limited to her female costars!

Willie Garson, 54 — who played Parker’s friend Stanford Blatch — was also quick to endorse her.

“I cant think of anyone who’s more prepared, more caring, more educated on the issues and more READY than @cynthiaenixon….please join her on this journey, together we can turn things around with candidates such as her,” he wrote alongside a clip of her campaign video."
Sarah Hyland Wears Wells Adams' Initial on Necklace After Being Inspired by Taylor Swift Song,https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-wears-wells-adams-initial-necklace-after-being-inspired-taylor-swift-song-90694,www.etonline.com,43,1,"Sarah Hyland seems to be keeping Wells Adams close to her heart.

On Tuesday, the 26-year-old actress shared a selfie that showcased a necklace that had a charm of the Bachelor in Paradise star's first initial. She also tagged Adams in the Instagram image.

In defense of her accessory, Hyland captioned the pic with a lyric from Taylor Swift's new song, ""Call It What You Want,"" off her upcoming Reputation album.

""Call it what you want ? #notbecauseheownsme,"" she wrote.

The Modern Family star -- who's a self-proclaimed fan of Bachelor Nation -- seems to be keeping a sense of humor about her rumored relationship with Adams.

After the two dressed up together for Halloween and shared some cuddly photos on Instagram, one of Hyland's fans dug up a tweet from 2012, in which she wrote: ""Those who think I have a thing for any of the guys on The Bachelorette, think again and stop reading into things I say! I'm simply a fan.""

On Monday, Hyland re-posted her tweet from over five years ago, and admitted that she found it humorous. ""Whoever went five years back in time to find this, thank you,"" she quipped. ""Havin' a real good laugh at the moment ?.""

Also this week, a source told ET that Hyland and Adams are in fact dating, and that they've been talking for a few months.

Hyland split from her boyfriend of two years, Shadowhunters star Dominic Sherwood, in August, while Adams was rumored to be dating fellow Bachelor in Paradise star Danielle Maltby, but denied the claims to ET in September.

Here's more on the 33-year-old reality star's relationship status:"

My mouth drop open. Why she never tell me this before? “You saying people think I got the black magic?” Aibileen speaking to Minny (Pg 24)

“Please. Find you another colored maid. A young’un. Somebody. . .else.”

He black. Blacker than me. (Pg 189) Aibileen, comparing her complexion to a roach"
Khloe Kardashian's 'Revenge Body' Season 2 Trailer Is Actually So Emotional,https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/khloe-kardashians-revenge-body-trailer-video/2083086,www.elitedaily.com,48,1,"Please do me a solid and do not watch the Season 2 Trailer of Khloé Kardashian's Revenge Body if you're hungover from four glasses of weirdly affordable wine and one family-sized box of Cheerios. Trust me. You'll cry. Khloé's hit series following the weight loss journies of varying contestants is back, and the sneak peek is so, so emotional.

I don't know, you guys. Blame it my own insecurities growing up as someone who could always stand to lose a few pounds. Blame it on the fact my literal job is to closely follow the Kardashians' lives which has created an inflated sense of personal connection to their family. Blame it on the fact I'm almost 30 years old and don't have anything besides cereal in my house as a source of nourishment... but this trailer really, really got me.

Here's the premise of the show in a freaking nutshell. As you guys know, Khloé found fitness as a means to cope with her anxiety and take control of her life. Over the past few years, we've watched her totally transform into a freak-in-a-good-way workout fiend, and become a sculpted warrior. For her, it began around the time her marriage started to unravel with ex-husband Lamar Odom, resulting in what she now calls her ""revenge body.""

Sounds like a hit TV show premise, right?

RIGHT!

In the show, Khloé and a team of trainers help contestants get the body of their dreams as a way to combat the people and things in their lives that dragged them down in the past.

IMBd summarizes,

She's [Khloe] giving them the chance to reinvent themselves from the inside out, with the help of a team of elite trainers, stylists and nutritionists. Each hourlong episode follows the participants' progress to transform their bodies and empower their confidence in 12 weeks, leading to final reveals and chances to defy those who doubted them.

OK. Do you guys feel adequately prepared to watch the trailer now? Take a breath.

Here you go.

I'll give you a minute.

WHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE PART? Is it when the dance instructor yells, ""Don't you want to prove your mom wrong?!"" Or when Khloé says it's not just about a hot body – it's about body, mind, and soul?? OR IS IT WHEN THE GUY DANCES IN THE SHOE STORE???

For me, it's when Khloé lets that lucky human touch her butt... not that this is about Khloé's butt...

But also, can we be the most real for a second? Think back before KUWTK was a thing. How would you guys feel if you were a young 20-something girl and your sister was Kim Freaking Kardashian, the breakout sex-icon of your generation? Probably a little insecure, don't you think?

Khloé explains in the trailer,

My entire life I've been compared to my sisters. I don't look like them. I was chubby and tall. I lost a lot of confidence in myself. I found new me in this happiness and I want to share it with other people.

Sing it, sister.

This season's contestants also are totally inspiring and have deeply touching and relatable pasts that somehow led them to Khloé.

In the final moments of the trailer, we catch glimpses of body transformation reveals, people crying, and a quick shot of an engagement ring. I mean, this show packs personal inspiration, romance, AND a Kardashian... if that doesn't sound like your next favorite series, then Khloé and I literally can't help you.

Billie Lourd to Carrie Fisher one year after death: ‘I love you times infinity’,https://pagesix.com/2017/12/27/billie-lourd-to-carrie-fisher-one-year-after-death-i-love-you-times-infinity/,pagesix.com,64,1,"Billie Lourd shared a sweet story for her mother Carrie Fisher on the one-year anniversary of her death.

“My momby had an otherworldly obsession with the northern lights, but I never got to see them with her,” she wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.

Lourd, 25, explained that she took the trip Fisher never did and posted pictures of her and her step father Bruce Bozzi.

“We journeyed to northern Norway to see if we might ‘see the heavens lift up her dark skirts and flash her dazzling privates across [our] unworthy irises’. And she did.”

“I love you times infinity,” Lourd concluded.

In September, she told Ellen DeGeneres that life has been “surreal” since the loss of her mother and grandmother Debbie Reynolds, who died one day later.

“There’s no way to really explain it, and it’s so hard to talk about,” she said. “If I say that I’m doing good, I’m too happy, and if I say that I’m not doing good, then I’m a mess, so it’s really hard to know what to say about it because it really is so surreal and impossible to deal with.”

Mark Hamill also paid his respects to his longtime friend and “Star Wars” co-star via social media on Wednesday.

“No one’s ever really gone…” he posted along with photos of the two of them."

Sam Waterston to Reprise 'Law & Order' Role on 'SVU',https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/law-order-svu-season-19-sam-waterston-returning-as-jack-mccoy-1041638,www.hollywoodreporter.com,25,1,"Jack is back.

Sam Waterston, who starred on Law & Order for 16 seasons, will reprise his role as prosecutor Jack McCoy on Law & Order: SVU, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

The actor will guest-star on an upcoming episode of the NBC spinoff’s 19th season, which kicks off Sept. 27. The role reunites him with new SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin, who worked on Waterston’s first two seasons of the mothership and helped create the character of Jack McCoy. Fellow SVU exec producer Julie Martin also worked on the final season of the original series.

Waterston joined the NBC legal drama in its fifth season and stayed through the drama’s 20th and final season. NBC then abruptly canceled the series in 2010 — one season before Law & Order could break Gunsmoke‘s record for longest-running primetime drama.

Law & Order‘s abrupt cancellation means the writers were unable to wrap up storylines for Jack and the other characters. (Fellow longtime cast member S. Epatha Merkerson had already planned to exit at the end of season 20 and was given an emotional final season arc in which her character battled breast cancer.)

This will actually be Jack McCoy’s fourth appearance on SVU following several crossovers in the early aughts. In recent years, SVU has welcomed back other characters from the mothership including prosecutors Connie Rubirosa (Alana De La Garza) and Michael Cutter (Linus Roache).

During his 16-season stint on Law & Order, Waterston won a Screen Actors Guild award for best actor in a drama series and earned three Emmy nominations in the same category. Since Law & Order, he was gone on to roles in Aaron Sorkin’s HBO drama The Newsroom as well as movies including Miss Sloane and Please Be Normal.

In addition to his starring role on the Netflix comedy Grace & Frankie, Waterston will next appear in the Netflix Western miniseries Godless. He is repped by Gersh and Industry Entertainment.

Despite his busy schedule, Waterston expressed interest in reviving Jack McCoy as recently as 2015, when NBC and Dick Wolf were in talks for a potential Law & Order revival. “Sure, I’d love it,” Waterston told THR in May 2015. “Got to break the record.”

Chernuchin also talked to THR about bringing back Jack McCoy earlier this year when he was the showrunner on Chicago Justice. Justice saw the return of several flagship favorites including Richard Brooks, Lorraine Toussaint and Tovah Feldshuh. “We actually talked for a brief second about having Sam come in, but we thought it was too early,” Chernuchin told THR in January. “But maybe in the future.”

However, Chicago Justice was canceled in May after one season and Chernuchin subsequently took over the top job at SVU. In his move to SVU, Chernuchin is bringing an important member of the Law & Order universe with him: prosecutor Peter Stone, the son of Law & Order character Ben Stone, played by Waterston’s predecessor Michael Moriarty. Philip Winchester played the role of Peter on Chicago Justice and will join SVU full-time later this season.

“We’ve connected all the Dick Wolf shows,” Chernuchin told THR recently about adding Winchester to the cast. “The original New York franchise, the Chicago franchise, it’s like the small Dickensian universe in London where different characters show up in different novels. That was one of the intriguing things to me by bringing Philip over, is to connect all the franchises.”

Like SVU, which pulls solid numbers in syndication on USA Network, Law & Order continues to live on in repeats on TNT, SundanceTV and WeTV, among other channels.

Law & Order: SVU returns Wednesday, Sept. 27 at 9 p.m."

The 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was once again an event to remember, with Victoria's Secret Angel Adriana Lima walking in the show for the 18th and final time.

The woman dubbed 'the greatest Angel of all time' was joined by the next generation of fashion stars for the show, with Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid also taking to the catwalk in New York City on Sunday, for the televised performance of the show, which took place November 8.

Complementing the stars on stage were a host of high-profile musical acts including Shawn Mendes, Halsey, Rita Ora and The Chainsmokers.

Three beauties: [L-R] Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid took to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show catwalk in New York City on Sunday, for the televised performance of the show, which took place November 8

Adriana Lima became emotional during a farewell tribute in which she was dubbed 'the greatest Angel of all time'.

The 37-year-old walked in her first VS Show in 2000, when she was just 19-years-old and has been associated with the lingerie brand for 20 years.

The mother-of-two showed off her sensational legs in panties and feather-adorned high heels which added inches to the statuesque beauty's 5ft10in frame.

On her upper half, the Brazilian stunner was clad in decorative silver lacework and wore hundreds of peacock feathers on her back.

Lima became emotional during her penultimate walk down the VS catwalk, which was set to a slowed-down cover of Fatboy Slim's Praise You.

At one point the tearful model bowed her head and clasped her hands together as she wept.

The show opened with singer Leela James performing the first song 'This Is Me' from The Greatest Showman soundtrack.

The Chainsmokers performed next with American country pop singer Kelsea Ballerini, who provided the vocals for their collaborative song called This Feeling.

Rita Ora sang her single, Let You Love Me, and even escorted Behati Prinsloo down part of the the runway while the model's supportive husband Adam Levine cheered her on from the crowd.

Halsey was the next star to take to the stage as she performed her single Without Me. She also gave a shoutout to her BFF Bella Hadid, who joined sister Gigi at this year's show.

In a later performance, Bebe Rexha was dazzling in magenta as she sang for the PINK segment of the show.

Jasmine Tookes opened the Floral Fantasy portion of the show, while Shawn Mendes sang his hit, Lost in Japan, wearing a suit and toting a guitar on his back.

Swedish model Elsa Hosk, 30, was chosen to wear the coveted Fantasy Bra for the evening.

This year's Atelier Swarovski-designed Dream Angels Fantasy Bra was made with over 2,100 Swarovski lab-created synthetic diamonds, as well as 'responsibly sourced' topaz and sterling silver.

There are more than 71 carats, including a particularly large gem at the center. All in all, it took over 930 hours to make.

According to the brand, the bra is worth a heart-stopping $1 million, though Grant Mobley, a diamond expert and gemologist, estimates the bra is only worth $56,800.

He noted to the New York Post that the based on the weight of the diamonds in the bra, it's easy to guess how much they cost — and while mined diamonds might tally up to that price, lab-grown diamonds are worth less.

'Only natural diamonds from the earth would put the value of the bra into the millions of dollars, as in past shows,' he said.

For the show's final act, English rock band The Struts performed as Kendall Jenner took to the catwalk.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star looked every inch the supermodel as she strutted in lace panties and bra, while her famous mom Kris Jenner waved proudly from the front row.

The event's closer was, of course, Adriana Lima, who drew the curtain on the 2018 iteration of the fashion spectacular with moon and stars additions to her lace teddy.

Video emerges of George Clooney scooter accident in Italy; actor released from hospital,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/10/george-clooney-hospitalized-after-scooter-accident-italy/770548002/,www.usatoday.com,90,1,"George Clooney was briefly hospitalized in Italy Tuesday after his scooter collided with a car.

The 57-year-old actor was riding a scooter in Olbia on the island of Sardinia when a Mercedes cut across his path and caused a collision, throwing Clooney over the top of his scooter, according to the Associated Press. He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, but his injuries were not serious and he was discharged.

“George was treated and released from an Olbia hospital,"" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. ""He is recovering at home and will be fine.”

Surveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia.

The video shows what is reported to be Clooney's scooter crashing into the car while another scooter alongside him manages to veer around it. A figure appearing to be Clooney is thrown over the front of his bike and up in the air before landing on the asphalt, where the car driver and other witnesses come to help.

Clooney is in Italy filming a ""Catch-22"" miniseries that will run on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller's 1961 novel that was also made into a 1970 film.

Clooney will portray Col. Cathcart (played by Martin Balsam in the film), marking Clooney's first TV role since he left NBC's ER in 1999. He will also direct the series with production partner Grant Heslov.

“We’re up for any kind of suggestions, but Luca thinks Cafont Croissant is, like, the coolest name,” the Younger actress, 30, joked during The Late Late Show with James Corden on Monday, June 11.

“When I just refer it as ‘Cafont,’ and I’m like, ‘That would be so cool, nobody at school’s gonna be named Cafont.’ He’s like, ‘Croissant. Cafont Croissant,’” she added. “It, like, goes together, there’s no separating the two.”

Duff announced on June 8 that she and boyfriend Matthew Koma are expecting their first child together, a baby girl. She shares Luca, 6, with ex-husband Mike Comrie.

“The beginning was a little… he was surprised, and now he’s warming up to the idea,” Duff said of Luca on Monday night. “I think it’s a girl, but he told his friends at school the other day that he’s having a sister that’s part red-butt monkey, so we’ll see. We never know.”

“I think [if] you have history and a past with someone and love — and just because it doesn’t work out the first time, the second time, as long as there’s not too much damage done — then, it can always work out again,” she told The Talk late last year."

Frances Bean Cobain has a lot to celebrate this Valentine's Day.

On Tuesday, the daughter of Courtney Love and the late Kurt Cobain posted a selfie to Instagram from her time in Oahu, Hawaii, and announced that she has been sober for two years.

""The fact that I’m sober isn’t really public knowledge, decidedly and deliberately, but I think it’s more important to put aside my fear about being judged or misunderstood or typecast as one specific thing,"" she writes. ""I want to have the capacity to recognize and observe that my journey might be informative, even helpful to other people who are going through something similar or different.""

Frances admits that sobriety isn't always easy. ""It is an everyday battle to be in attendance for all the painful, [bizarre], uncomfortable, tragic, f*cked up things that have ever happened or will ever happen,"" she continues. ""Self destruction and toxic consumption and deliverance from pain is a lot easier to adhere to.""

The 25-year-old rock n' roll heiress adds, ""So I’m gonna take today to celebrate my vibrant health and the abundance of happiness, gratitude, awareness, compassion, empathy, strength, fear, loss, wisdom, peace and the myriad of other messy emotions I feel constantly.""

Frances further insists that ""life does get better, if you want it to.""

""I only know what works for me and seeking to escape my life no longer works for me,"" she notes. ""Peace, love, empathy (I’m going to reclaim this phrase and define it as something that’s mine, filled with hope and goodness and health, because I want to.)""

Over the past two years, Frances has seemed more family oriented, as she's posted several tributes to her father. Take a look:"

Alec Baldwin speaks at the Oxford Union in the U.K., Jan. 19, 2018.

Actor Alec Baldwin has denied that he ""punched anyone over a parking spot"" following his Friday arrest on an assault and harassment charges in New York.

In a pair of tweets dispatched from his Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation Twitter account, Baldwin said that he realizes ""that it has become a sport to tag people w[ith] as many negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment,"" but that ""no matter how reverberating the echos [sic], it doesn't make the statements true.""

Baldwin was charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment after he punched someone during what police officials described as a dispute near his home in New York City's Greenwich Village.

Baldwin is expected to appear in court on Nov. 26.

A representative for the actor had no comment.

Baldwin, 60, has faced legal trouble in the Big Apple in the past.

In 2014, after a New York City police officer issued him a summons him for riding his bike the wrong way on a one-way street, Baldwin allegedly said, ""I don't have identification. Just give me the f---ing summons” and “wrap this summons around your head.”

A police source added at the time that Baldwin “got arrogant and loud,"" which is why he was given his second summons for disorderly conduct.

Baldwin responded in a tweet of his own, naming the officer and declaring, ""New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.""

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, whom Baldwin impersonates on ""Saturday Night Live,"" had a few words of encouragement for the actor, when told about the impending charge.

“I wish him luck,"" he said."
"Independent Spirit Awards 2019: We the Animals, Eighth Grade lead nominations",https://ew.com/movies/2018/11/16/film-independent-spirit-awards-2019-nominees/,ew.com,209,1,"The Film Independent Spirit Awards have unveiled this year’s list of nominees, honoring the year’s best in independent film and propelling films like Eighth Grade, First Reformed, and If Beale Street Could Talk further into the Oscar conversation.

The Spirit Awards, held in a tent at a Santa Monica beach on Feb. 23, the day before the Oscars ceremony, honor the best achievements in films made within a $20 million budget. The awards, voted for by members of Film Independent, often help to indicate which films will go on to win key Oscars; Moonlight in 2017, Spotlight in 2016, Birdman in 2015 and 12 Years A Slave in 2014 all won best feature at the Spirit Awards and went on to pick up the Best Picture Oscar.

Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade, Paul Schrader’s First Reformed, and Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here all earned four nominations, including best feature. Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace rounded out the Best Feature category (and scored three nominations apiece).

Jeremiah Zagar’s We the Animals scored the most nominations with five, including best first feature, best supporting actor for Raúl Castillo, and the Someone to Watch Award.

The Indie Spirits aren’t a perfect predictor for what will eventually triumph at the Oscars, but they are a decent indicator of what will be in the conversation. (Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma, for example, has been hailed as an early Oscars frontrunner, and it was only eligible at the Spirit Awards in the international film category.)

The winners will be announced Feb. 23 in an awards ceremony broadcast live on IFC. See the full list of nominees below.

Justin and Emma were photographed together on Tuesday, May 29, at Hotel du Cap-Eden Rock in the South of France, alongside friends including Sienna Miller. The crew reportedly chilled at a cliffside cabana and enjoyed a swim after sharing lunch. ""They laughed all afternoon long,"" said the source. The day before, both actors were spotted at the Louis Vuitton Cruise fashion show and lunch, although they reportedly did not go together. ""Their friends and colleagues were with them during the day [on Monday] and they are just friends,"" a second source told E! Meanwhile, Justin is relaxing and enjoying his bachelorhood since he split from Jennifer Aniston. ""He's casually dating, but it's nothing more,"" the first source says. ""He's in a great place and very happy. He's enjoying being social and meeting people from all walks of life. He is excited about doing new things and traveling. He's looking forward to a great summer of fun and just seeing where it leads. He is letting loose for the first time in several years. He doesn't have anyone else to be responsible for or to report back to and he's taking advantage of that and having fun. Justin seems single and very much moved on from his marriage. He seems to really be enjoying himself.""

Julia Roberts to present George Clooney with AFI Lifetime Achievement Award The American Film Institute has decided George Clooney will be the recipient of the 2018 AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, which is given each year to someone ""whose talent has in a fundamental way advanced the film art; whose accomplishment has been acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers and the general public; and whose work has stood the test of time,"" according to Variety. George's pal and longtime pal, Julia Roberts, is set to present the award at the June 7 ceremony in Los Angeles — which basically means you can count on at least one reference to George's habit of pranking his co-stars, pouring tequila shots at (royal) weddings or hosting boat parties at which famous guests wear shirts that read, ""George Clooney is a beautiful man.""

Kendall Jenner and Ben Simmons double date with Jordyn Woods and Devin Booker Kendall Jenner still seems intent on keeping her lips sealed when it comes to her rumored new beau, 76s star Ben Simmons. But as TMZ points out, the two aren't trying too hard to deny there's something between them. On Wednesday, May 30, Kendall and Ben stepped out for some fun at Nice Guy in West Hollywood. They reportedly dodged cameras by arriving separately. Kendall even pretended to leave at one point — then ducked back in and hung out with the basketball player for a few more hours. According to TMZ, they left around 1 a.m. in an SUV with Kylie Jenner's best friend, Jordyn Woods, who also happened to have been out for the evening with an NBA star — the Phonex Suns' Devin Booker.

Kendrick, 30, follows in the footsteps of artists including Duke Ellington and Bob Dylan with his win. ""It's an honor,"" he later said in a Facebook Live video shared by ET.

Offset buys a car for the man who helped him after his accident When a passerby spotted Migos rapper Offset trapped inside his crumpled car and injured following an accident in Atlanta two weeks ago, he raced over to help.

Once Jamar managed to rescue Offset, he walked the rapper to safety since he reportedly did not own wheels of his own. Now, Jamar's enjoying the karma payback from that good deed.

Fans spot something fishy about Portia de Rossi's 'Arrested Development' scenes Was there some sort of compromise arrangement between Portia de Rossi and the producers of ""Arrested Development"" that got her back on the show for Season 5 despite her retirement plans? It seems feasible, given the complaints lodged by viewers this week, who called out the show for using ""sloppy editing"" and seemingly using a green screen for many of the scenes in which Portia appeared. ""I'm not sure who did the green screen work for the new series of Arrested Development but I'm assuming it was some sort of dog in a hat,"" griped one user on Twitter (via the Daily Mail). Others pointed to the fact that the storyline had Portia's character, Lindsey, covered by a sheet repeatedly as more potential evidence that the actress didn't shoot her scenes with the rest of the cast. ""Was Portia de Rossi green screened into every scene? Good god I love me some Lindsey but this isn't subtle,"" another Twitter user posted. Portia recently appeared on ""Ellen,"" where she told her wife, Ellen DeGeneres, she'd decided to quit acting but got talked into doing one more season as a Bluth by the show's creator. ""I called Mitch Hurwitz … and I said if there is a Season five, I wont be doing it because I quit acting and he seemed really understanding and he totally got it,' Portia said at the time. ""We had a great conversation and then he wrote me into five episodes."" RELATED: Long-lasting celebrity couples

Is Shailene Woodley changing her stance on feminism? Four years ago, Shailene Woodley seemed to be using a skewed definition of feminism when she told Time she wasn't a feminist because she loves men and she doesn't think ""[taking] the men away from the power"" was the right approach. She was asked about the controversial quotes in a recent interview about her new film ""Adrift."" It's unclear whether she now understands that feminism is defined not as the practice of man-hating but as ""the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes."" But she does seem to be changing her tune a bit. Asked by Vulture if the quote was taken out of context, Shailene implies that it was. ""And that quote was so long ago,"" she says. ""It was also in a different time of feminism. You know, feminism has had so many forms over its many, many decades of being around. To me, I say today that I resonate as a feminist. But take that word out of it — a word is a word, a movement is a movement — practice and action are what actually makes a difference. So I can call myself a feminist all day long. Or I can say I'm not a feminist all day long. But if my daily interaction with the world is taking steps to uplift, empower — not only women, but also men in their relationships with women, and women and their relationships with men, and women to women, and improving sisterhood with women, and changing our judicial system to reflect that which society is asking for — that, to me, is where my greatest interest lies."" She adds: ""But for the sake of the movement, and also for my beliefs, I think at this point it is important to use that word as a tool just for means of other people understanding who you are."" Huh. Vulture seems to read the lengthy and roundabout response as evidence of Shailene having ""taken stock of how her passions have been chopped into sound bites."" Uh, if that's the case, it worked.

Keegan-Michael Key dishes on his wedding plans with Elisa Pugliese Keegan-Michael Key is about to be off the market for real. Speaking to Us Weekly, the longtime ""Key & Peele"" star recently shared some of the details around plans to marry producer Elisa Pugliese early next month. ""So I'm getting married in nine days in my home. My fiancée is the most wonderful and passionate and sensible woman at the same time,"" he told Us. ""Why would we get married in any place else if we love our home? Let's have a reception upstairs and then we're having a party the next day. A big party. So, very intimate wedding, very big party."" Keegan-Michael, who was previously married to Cynthia Blaise, and Elisa announced their engagement last fall when the groom-to-be tweeted that he was ""the luckiest man ever"" and gushed: ""She shows me every day that each of us has the ability to help make the world a better place.""

Elizabeth Olsen and Robbie Arnett make debut at Emmy party,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4892840/Elizabeth-Olsen-beau-Robbie-Arnett-make-debut.html,www.dailymail.co.uk,42,1,"Elizabeth Olsen and Robbie Arnett have been dating for months.

But they only made heir first official appearance as a couple on Friday evening.

The stars looked in love as they were arm-in-arm at the 2017 Gersh Emmy Party in Los Angeles.

Official: Elizabeth Olsen and Robbie Arnett have been dating for months, but only made their first public appearance in LA on Friday

Elizabeth, 28, is an actress whose sisters are the twins Mary Kate and Ashley from the TV series Full House. They are now fashion designers.

Robbie, 25, is the vocalist for the band Milo Greene, a band he started with friends while in college in 2009.

Elizabeth and Robbie were first linked back in March of this year when they were seen holding hands.

Networking night: They were at a bash thrown by the Gersh Agency, a talent agency firm

The facts: Elizabeth, 28, is an actress whose sisters are the twins Mary Kate and Ashley from the TV series Full House. They are now fashion designers. Robbie, 25, is the vocalist for the band Milo Greene

Hobnobbing: Elizabeth was also photographed with David Gersh. He is the co-president of the Gersh Agency

At the splash Emmy event Elizabeth wore a cream-colored sweater and wore her blonde locks down.

Her partner modeled a daring sheer pink blouse.

Elizabeth was also photographed with David Gersh. He is the co-president of the Gersh Agency.

Lovely ladies: Also there was Ariel Winter, left, and Debra Messing, right

In May Olsen told Elle: 'It's a privilege to get to have a job in this industry, and I would never change it for the world, but I have a hard time with the pressure of looking cool, like fitting into dresses that were off a model's body.'

Most actresses are give sample sizes from fashion houses that are size 0 and 2 and they expect the stars to fit into them.

'I am not that. I don't think I'm fat and I don't think I'm overweight, I'm very happy with what I look like, but I don't fit into those things and it's a little uncomfortable. So, that kind of part of the job is a little frustrating.'

The others: Her sister Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in May in NYC

She added: 'The cool thing about watching my sisters is to me they've always handled everything with so much class.

'When you meet them in a work environment you know how capable they are, and how well their minds work, because you can't miss it. It's because of how disciplined they are, how interested they are, and how committed they are.

'So, to me, no one can take anything away from you or try and devalue you, if you know that you're capable, and you know that you deserve to be there because you did put in the work, and you did put in the time.'

Elizabeth then talked about some of her Wind River co-stars: 'On set, I think if you're there and you're with all these men –I mean Taylor and Jeremy could be intimidating men, because they're very direct and straightforward—there's not a lot of BS with them–I can match that, and I don't feel like I'm making myself like a dude, but I can match that kind of, Yeah, I know why I'm here, too. I have an opinion, let's talk about it. I think women in history are supposed to be quiet, and supporters, and nurturers, and agreeable, but the value of your opinion is huge.'

Glover, who scared many of his fans when he vowed to retire his rap name last year, sang like it wouldn’t be his last. The rapper-singer seldom performs so the falsetto was a surprise but it was welcomed. He brought the soothing voice from the end of the track on, too. The precocious nine-year-old J.D. McCrary, who’s set to play Simba in the Lion King live-action film, complemented the singer with stunning vocals. The duo let their passion carry them to the end of the performance.

Until then, expect Glover at all corners, including the new season of the FX series Atlanta on March 1."
"‘SEAL Team,’ ‘Valor,’ ‘The Brave': What Separates Network TV’s New Military Dramas?",https://www.thewrap.com/seal-team-valor-the-brave-military-dramas/,www.thewrap.com,19,1,"There seemed to be a theme at the 2017 Television Critics Association (TCA) summer press tour and it had to do with dusty vehicles and camouflage.

Three military dramas will be hitting broadcast networks this fall: “The Brave” on NBC, “Valor” on the CW and “SEAL Team” on CBS. That’s not even taking into account the number of military shows already on TV, including long-running procedurals like “NCIS” and the post-apocalyptic “The Last Ship” on TNT. Other shows, like “The Night Shift” and the upcoming “S.W.A.T.” aren’t directly about the military, but feature characters with service pasts or with direct connections to combat scenarios.

Showrunners and other execs said that the move wasn’t in response to current events and a possible resurgence in American pride; it was more of a coincidence. And it wasn’t until the TCAs that they noticed how their shows compared to each other.

The executive producers, showrunners and casts still made their cases to press, attempting to separate their show from the pack. While they are similar on the surface — and have comparable distinctive traits — there are some slight differences. But is it enough? Below, we’ve broken down the three dramas to see if first impressions are enough to provide uniqueness.

“VALOR”

“Valor” is the CW’s first military drama. Compared to “SEAL Team” and “The Brave,” it’s also specifically female-driven, character-focused and plays to more soapy sensibilities.

While the conflicts of the pilot episode revolve around a botched mission and what exactly went wrong, protagonist Nora (played by Christina Ochoa) is dealing with the consequences of her PTSD, going back to flying after a month away and her growing dependence on prescription drugs. Meanwhile, her colleague Gallo (played by Matt Barr) is in a relationship with another woman who works on the base, but isn’t allowed to interact with her.

Kyle Jarrow, writer and executive producer on “Valor,” said he was inspired to create a military show because his brother served in the 173rd Airborne, which meant he got a closer look at how that kind of lifestyle affected people.

“Folks in the military, like my brother, like these characters, are human beings. They are sleeping with people…. They’re cheating on people. They’re struggling with questions of personal morality and personal choices, just like we all do,” Jarrow explained. “It felt really important to dramatize that in telling a full story of what it’s like to be someone in the military.”

Because it’s on the CW, the scope is much smaller than on the other military shows. The pilot episode takes place almost entirely on the base and in the homes of the characters involved.

“SEAL TEAM”

So, is “Valor” the military drama of the season? You could say that, but “SEAL Team” also promises that viewers can expect more character-driven stories instead of just simply military raids or narratives. If anything, it’s not about the military at all, according to executive producers.

“I don’t think our show is about the military. I think it’s about the people who do this work rather than about the work itself in some way,” EP Benjamin Cavell said.

Star David Boreanaz agreed, calling it more of a “workplace show” that happens to involve special ops.

“What’s interesting is the character that’s involved in the workplace show and how he deals with that specifically and, when he comes home, how he deals with his own inner turmoils and how he deals with his personal life,” Boreanaz, who plays Jason Hayes, leader of the Tier One team, explained to reporters.

To get at the heart of those characters, the “SEAL Team” execs stressed how much they utilized military consultants on the show.

“We’ve had the real people who do this work in this project from the beginning, not from after we wrote a script and we called them as tech advisers,” Cavell said. “Their involvement predates that, and the DNA of this show is about the authenticity of the real stories of the people that we’re making it about — and I couldn’t be prouder of it.”

Regardless of character work, the show does follow the Navy’s most elite special ops force, so there is some focus on current events, like the battle with the Islamic State. In a first look uploaded by CBS, the team is shown strategizing about a mission, going into a foreign country, and then going about attempting to succeed.

It’s unclear if this will play into our current political climate in any way, or if it’ll address the ethics and problems that go along with invading foreign lands and dealing with other people, specifically when they’re of a different religion, race or culture. The EPs promise, though, that “SEAL Team” isn’t all-American.

“We want to have a diversity in our storytelling, and we don’t want to be a chest-pumping show,” said co-showrunner Ed Redlich. “Again, it’s the American military, and they go on, and they do stories. But, again, it’s how creatively and artistically you choose to tell a story.”

“THE BRAVE”

Then there’s “The Brave,” which also promises that it’ll be more about the people than the military set pieces. Execs say that it’ll stand out due its more gender-balanced and diverse cast. The main, eight-member list includes three women and four people of color.

“I think what really drew us to join this project was the strength of women, the female characters in the show, not just out in the field, but in the DIA,” said co-showrunner Chris Ord.

In this one, the characters are what the execs call “realistic.”

“I am really interested in resiliency as a characteristic of human beings. And so I’ve been a fan about reading about special forces operators for years, and I wanted to see them portrayed in a way that I felt was realistic,” said series creator Dean Georgaris.

What separates “The Brave” from the pack is that, although it follows an elite special-ops military team, NBC describes it as a group of “elite undercover military heroes.” Characters are involved with intelligence work, sniping and other more discreet lines of combat. The focus is less on all-out warfare and more on espionage.

“This isn’t your typical straightforward military show,” said actor Demetrius Grosse. “The thing that makes the show unique and special is that you see the behind-the-scenes things that you normally wouldn’t associate with military: espionage, code switching, deep cover kind of stuff.”"
Jason Biggs and Jenny Mollen Welcome Son Lazlo,https://people.com/parents/jason-biggs-jenny-mollen-welcome-son-lazlo/,people.com,25,1,"Jason Biggs and Jenny Mollen are seeing blue — again!

The fun-loving family of three just became a family of four with the arrival of the couple’s second son, a rep confirms to PEOPLE, saying, “Mom, dad and big brother Sid are doing great!”

Born on Monday, Oct. 2, at Lenox Hill Hospital in N.Y.C., Lazlo Biggs weighed 7 lbs., 1 oz., and measured 20 inches long upon his much-anticipated arrival.

“Hello everybody. I’m just sitting in the back of the car with Jason and my second child,” Mollen, 38, said in the first of a series of clips shared on Instagram Stories Thursday, showing herself and Biggs in a car with their newborn son.

Addressing her husband after panning the camera to their new little guy, situated between his parents in his car seat, Mollen says, “Baby, you have two boys now.”

“I know, WTF,” Biggs, 39, replies. (The couple also share 3½-year-old Sid.)

“I had to break out of the hospital, they wanted to keep me, but I’m leaving — I’m leaving with wires attached,” Mollen adds. Biggs replies jokingly, “Was I supposed to sign [discharge] papers or pay or anything?”

“I’m gonna go home and eat my placenta,” says Mollen, with Biggs adding, “I’m excited to try it.”

Shortly after, Mollen posted a video to Instagram of herself in a hospital bed, gazing at a golden pineapple-shaped ur on a chair. “Obviously had to bring Teets for moral support…. #babybiggs,” she wrote, referring to her beloved dog who died in March 2016.

Mollen and Biggs leveraged their signature silly sides to share their pregnancy news with the world in April, sharing a photo to Instagram showing the actress and author using a NoseFrida snot sucker on her husband.

Since announcing Baby No. 2 on the way, the couple revealed they were having a second son, with Mollen being hilariously open about the realities of parenting while pregnant — and dealing with placenta previa.

“It actually hasn’t been a big deal so far because I’m so early,” Mollen told PEOPLE in June. “I had a c-section the first time because I never dilated, so I’m not that concerned because I expected to have to be cut open again.”

At the time, Biggs explained that Sid wasn’t quite sure what was in store for him with a new sibling on the way. “While it’s still safely tucked away and he doesn’t have to actually physically deal with someone else in his space, he loves it,” the Orange Is the New Black star told PEOPLE.

Placenta previa and juggling a toddler and impending second-time motherhood aren’t the only challenges Mollen faced throughout her pregnancy. In early September, the Angel alum shared her experience with what she described as “prepartum” depression in an Instagram post and Story.

“I could already be in a depression,” she revealed. “I’m planning on eating my placenta, but I’m also anticipating a major emotional dive. I think that it’s chemical. I think people don’t talk about it enough.”

The following day, Mollen clarified that she was “totally fine” after receiving an influx of concerned emails. “This is normal — that’s what I’m trying to say,” she explained. “That it’s not weird … I would be more freaked out if I weren’t freaking out.”

Instead, it was the symbol of the Video Music Awards: the Moon Person.

Moon Person might be a new term to people who have watched the VMAs for years, and that's because for many years it used to be the Moonman. The trophy got a gender-neutral makeover before last year's awards ceremony.

“Why should it be a man?” Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, told the New York Times in 2017. “It could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.” The decision also came around the same time the MTV Movie and TV awards stopped separating their acting categories by gender.

The Moonman trophy has been around since the start of the VMAs. When the network started in 1981, it launched with footage of Apollo 11 blasting off into space, and an astronaut planting a flag with the MTV logo on the moon's surface. “Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" a voiceover noted, and the rest was history. That footage played every hour on MTV for the first five years of the network's history.

MTV's new gender neutrality reflects the music industry's push for LGBTQ representation and gender equality. And that was already seen in the early awards handed out Monday night. The winner for Push Artist of the Year, Hayley Kiyoko, shouted out women like her looking to make it in music. ""This validates any queer woman of color that you can follow your dream,"" she said in her acceptance speech.

A New 'American Horror Story’ Season 8 Cast Photo Includes A “Secret Friend” & Here’s Who It Could Be,https://www.bustle.com/p/a-new-american-horror-story-season-8-cast-photo-includes-a-secret-friend-heres-who-it-could-be-9661499,www.bustle.com,50,1,"American Horror Story has a knack for keeping details about the upcoming season tightly under wraps. (Remember when fans didn't even know the theme of Season 6 until the premiere aired?) But a new American Horror Story Season 8 cast photo, which Billy Eichner recently posted on his Instagram, proves that the series is taking that stealth to new (and spooky) heights.

The image features Eichner out to dinner with some of his Season 8 AHS castmates, which includes the likes of Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, Joan Collins, Cheyenne Jackson, Billie Lourd, Leslie Grossman and Adina Porter. However, the picture also blatantly blocks out one other mystery person, who Eichner calls a ""secret friend."" Covered up by an animated ghost, it's impossible to identify who this other cast member could be. Is it a beloved alum returning to the franchise or someone brand new to the series? Considering Ryan Murphy revealed that the new season would showcase a Murder House and Coven crossover, fans can definitely expect to see plenty of familiar faces.

When it comes to divulging any other details on the matter, Eichner has refused to say boo about it (get it?) apart from his cryptic caption: ""With (some of) this season’s @ahsfx cast at dinner a few weeks ago...and a secret friend...it’s gonna be a wild one! Can’t wait....""

Emma Roberts has already basically confirmed she'll be returning as Madison Montgomery, so it seems unlikely that Eichner would call her a ""secret"" friend, but there are plenty of other options out there for fans to look forward to. And since the show doesn't look like it'll be giving up the ghost any time soon, here are a few theories that'll get you even more excited for September.

Jessica Lange

Obviously, this would be a huge get for Murphy considering his former leading lady hasn't appeared on the series since her Season 4 departure, though she did star in Murphy's other series Feud. Murphy did state in a since-deleted tweet, reported by SyFy, that ""All the witches are being asked back,"" and who better to include in that category than Coven's most badass Supreme?

Connie Britton

Britton's portrayal of Murder House's Vivien Harmon was instantly iconic, and while the actress has appeared in several other of Murphy's projects (9-1-1 and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story), she has yet to come back to the AHS world. Perhaps Eichner's photo indicates that's all about to change. Britton is no longer starring in 9-1-1, so her schedule may allow for it.

Dylan McDermott

By the same token, McDermott could also be returning to his old stomping grounds, having played pivotal roles in both Season 1 and Season 2 of AHS before disappearing from the franchise without a trace. This seems like the perfect time for his return.

Lea Michele

Michele has always been a favorite of Murphy's ever since she starred as Rachel Berry in Glee. In fact, she went on to star in one of his other cult favorite horror shows, Scream Queens, yet she has never made an appearance on AHS itself. There's no time like the present to rectify that situation.

Anjelica Huston

Back in April, Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter that he was very ""interested"" in adding Huston to the AHS Season 8 roster. She'd be a perfect addition to the Coven portion of the story, given her past experience in playing the Grand High Witch in the '90s film The Witches (as seen above). Not to mention the fact that her brother Danny Huston has appeared on the show multiple times, even playing the Axeman in Coven. That has some serious sibling crossover potential.

Cher

Cher's son, Chaz Bono, has appeared in the last two seasons of American Horror Story. She even hung out with the cast of Cult last year backstage at her Las Vegas show. It certainly sounds like she could be game to join the cast herself if the opportunity presented itself. And it's not like she doesn't have any experience playing a witch.

Bette Midler

Because if Disney isn't going to give us the Hocus Pocus remake that we want, then this is the next best thing.

Whoever this ""secret friend"" is, viewers should be ready to be given quite a fright when the full cast for American Horror Story Season 8 is revealed."
Jenelle Evans Wedding Dress: Teen Mom 2 Star Found Her Dream Gown!,https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/teen-mom-2-jenelle-evans-wedding-dress-136899/,www.intouchweekly.com,1,1,"Jenelle Evans Is Going to Wear the Wedding Dress of Her Dreams on Her Special Day!





She said yes — to the dress! This year has been pretty great to Jenelle Evans — so far in 2017, she’s given birth to her baby girl Ensley Jolie, got engaged to her fiancé David Eason, and now she’s getting married! Shortly after she announced her wedding date, the Teen Mom 2 star tackled the next big step in the planning process — finding her perfect wedding dress!

The 25-year-old shared adorable snaps from her day spent wedding dress shopping in NYC for her September 23 nuptials. Jenelle wore an off-the-shoulder white dress with lace detail to symbolize that she’s the bride, and she stopped to pose in front of rows and rows of racks filled with gorgeous wedding dresses. “It’s finally happening!” she wrote, and she later revealed that she chose a dress.

Next, she shared a photo of her wedding dress shopping squad, posing with two unidentified brunettes. She said she brought her pals along to help, but many fans pointed out that Jenelle’s mom, Barbara Evans, was noticeably absent from such a special occasion.

“Where is your mom? Your mother needs to be there,” one fan wrote, and another commented, “Let me guess? You didn’t invite your mom to come with. So sad to not share these moments with people who have been there for you from the beginning.”

The mother-daughter duo is notorious for having a very tumultuous relationship, and their issues intensified back in 2011, shortly after Jenelle signed over custody of her son Jace to her mom. But since then, Jenelle has been awarded more visitation with Jace, and back in July, she gave fans an update on the state of her relationship with her mom.

“We are in the same situation,” the reality star told E! News. “We went to court about Jace and I got a visitation schedule set, but she’s still kind of bent out of shape because I still have resentment towards her for still keeping my son and we still butt heads.”

“I think our relationship’s lost,” she continued. “I don’t ever think there’s really coming back at any point in time.”

Pink reunites with Gwen Stefani to perform 'Just a Girl' — watch the video,https://www.today.com/popculture/pink-reunites-gwen-stefani-perform-just-girl-t130153,www.today.com,44,1,"Girl power!

Pink has been performing her own rocking version of No Doubt's 1995 hit ""Just a Girl"" for weeks on her ""Beautiful Trauma"" tour, but she got help from Gwen Stefani herself during her Thursday concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

The venue shared a short clip of the two ladies performing the punky feminist anthem — which they teamed up on once before at the 2012 iHeartRadio Music Festival. Watch as they harmonize on the song's soaring chorus and then cap things off with a sweet hug.

""I love you, Gwen,"" Pink, 38, tells her special guest as Stefani leaves the stage.

""It just doesn't get better than that. She's my spirit animal,"" she then gushes to the screaming crowd.

Lucky fans took to social media to share their own videos from the epic duet. ""The moment when all my childhood dreams came true,"" wrote one.

After the show, Pink shared a pic from the performance on Instagram, writing, ""Y'all don't even understand how much love I have for this chick, this rocker, this mama, this entrepreneur, this total OG badass that is @gwenstefani. There really aren't any comparisons as far as I'm concerned. Tonight was fun. Thanks friend.""

Stefani returned the love on her Instagram Story, sharing two short clips of herself having a blast at her buddy's concert.

""Thank you Pink for having me. I love you. That was awesome,"" she gushed.

No doubt about it, we want to hear more duets from these two!"
Jenelle Evans and Fiancé David Eason Just Checked a Major (& Tasty!) Item Off of Their Wedding To-Do List,https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/,people.com,63,1,"Bring on the cake!

Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans and her fiancé David Eason have been busily planning their wedding, but they got a little respite on Thursday when they embarked on a cake tasting.

“Had our cake tasting today!” Evans, 25, wrote in the caption of the photo she posted on Instagram. “#WeddingCake #September #SaveTheDate @easondavid88 (excuse my face, no makeup).”

In the photo, Evans and Eason sit side-by-side in front of a white platter, which has a variation of cake flavors and frostings for the couple to try.

The mother of three recently released her memoir Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom in which she describes Eason as being “so different from the other men I had been with.”

“I finally snagged a good man,” she writes.

The couple announced their engagement in February and revealed their Sept. 23 wedding date this past July with a romantic Instagram photo captioned: “I’m ready to make my life forever with you.”

Eason is the father of Evans’ third child, 6-month-old daughter Ensley. She also has two sons from previous relationships: Jace, 7, with ex Andrew Lewis, and Kaiser, 2, with ex-fiancé Nathan Griffith.

When the MTV star recently went wedding dress shopping, her mother was noticeably absent.

Barbara Evans told PEOPLE she has been left off the guest list for her daughter’s upcoming wedding.

“She’s been saying she’s having her wedding, running around with her family of friends, but you know what she says? ‘My mother Barbara is not invited,’ ” the 64-year-old said. “She’s not inviting me to her own wedding. It’s very painful.”

Ariana Grande Closes 'One Love Manchester' With Emotional Rendition of 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow',https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/06/05/ariana-grande-one-love-manchester-rainbow_n_16956766.html,www.huffingtonpost.ca,88,1,"Ariana Grande’s “One Love Manchester” charity benefit concert was a pop-filled night of defiant celebration and positive energy, but the singer closed the show on an emotional note.

The 23-year-old wrapped up the event with a heartfelt rendition of Judy Garland’s 1939 classic “Somewhere Over The Rainbow.”

Grande became overwhelmed during the performance and began to cry, pausing to pull herself together with the encouraging cheers of the 50,000-strong crowd behind her, before finishing the song, the Independent reported.

Grande’s mother, Joan, told Variety her daughter’s connection to the song goes deeper than just Manchester.

“I didn’t know she was going to sing it,” the elder Grande said. “It’s an emotional story: my father passed away two and half years ago, and that was the song she sang for him after he passed.”

The singer was very close to her grandfather, who died in 2014. Her mother said he always encouraged her to sing the “Wizard of Oz” ballad in public.

The ""One Love"" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande’s May 22 “Dangerous Woman” tour performance wrapped up. Money raised went to British Red Cross’s Manchester Emergency fund, which has raisedover £9.6 million ($16.8 million) for the victims and their families. An online shop has also been set up for people to buy merchandise benefitting the cause.

Security for the show was heightened after another terror attack took place in London less than 24 hours earlier, according to CNN.

The ""One Love"" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande’s May 22 “Dangerous Woman” tour performance wrapped up.

Grande and her manager, Scooter Braun, pulled the whole show together on short notice, while also making time to visit the victims and their families in hospital. She talked about meeting the mother of 15-year-old Olivia Campbell, who lost her life during the Manchester attack, during the show.

""As soon as I met her I started crying and I gave her a big hug and she said I should stop crying because Olivia would have wanted me to stop crying,” Grande said. She added Campbell’s mother told her that her daughter would’ve “wanted to hear the hits,” so Grande listened, and rejigged her setlist to include some more upbeat songs like “Side to Side.”

Earlier in the three-hour long show, Grande addressed her fans directly. “I love you so, so much. Thank you so much for coming together and being so loving and strong and unified. I love you guys so much, and I think the kind of unity you're displaying is the medicine the world needs right now,” she said.

The star-studded event at the Emirates Old Trafford Stadium also included performances and tributes from Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, Oasis’s Liam Gallagher, Pharrell Williams, the Black Eyed Peas, Take That, and many others.

Performers and attendees alike proved the concert’s mantra — love conquers hate and fear.

"Tiffany Haddish, Hollywood’s New Comedy Queen, Has One Crazy Story to Tell",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tiffany-haddish-new-queen-comedy-has-a-crazy-story-you-1119446,www.hollywoodreporter.com,27,1,"We’ve just reached cruising altitude when Tiffany Haddish orders her first drink. “Vodka,” she says, batting her long, thick lashes, “on the rocks.”

If we were to stop here and get technical, it isn’t actually Haddish’s first drink. Her cocktail of choice — a few ice cubes, fruit if you’ve got it — has been flowing freely since we hit the first-class lounge ahead of our flight from San Francisco (where she was performing stand-up) to New York (where she’s shooting a movie). But Haddish, the hottest comedy star in Hollywood thanks to her breakout role in 2017’s Girls Trip, isn’t the type for whom you’d want to get technical. Doing so would surely take the fun out of hanging with her, which can be a test of one’s composure as she dances, flirts and heckles her way through every encounter. In preparing for my weekend with her, Girls Trip‘s producer Will Packer offered only: “Buckle up.”

At 38, Haddish is doing celebrity on her own terms, unselfconsciously and filter-free. At times, you may wonder if maybe she didn’t get her copy of the Celebrity Rule Book — but it’s far more likely she did and never bothered to crack it open. She famously repeats red carpet looks — expect her white Alexander McQueen gown to resurface when she hosts the MTV Movie & TV Awards on June 18 — and surfs from talk show couch to talk show couch dishing on adventures with her growing roster of A-list friends. Toss out any famous name, and there’s a decent chance Haddish has a good story.

With more than five hours ahead of us, I decide to make a game of it. I start easy by asking about Leonardo DiCaprio, since I had heard her joke before about wanting to have his baby.

“Yeah, I met him at a party two, three months ago, and I asked him if he’d let me hit that,” she begins. “He’s like, ‘Tiffany, you’re so funny.’ I’m like, ‘I’m serious.’ And then he goes, ‘I mean, I’d do it, but …’ I was like, ‘Come on, wasn’t you in a squad? The coochie squad or something?’ [Editor’s note: DiCaprio was famously a member of the “pussy posse” with pals Tobey Maguire and Kevin Connolly.] I told him, ‘My only stipulation: I wanna do it with you as your character in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.’ He starts bustin’ up laughin’. ‘Why?’ he asks, and I say, ‘Cause I feel like that performance deserves a real reward and that reward is this (gestures at her own body).’ He starts goin’ into how he got into the role, how he worked with these kids and all this stuff, and I’m just listenin’ and listenin’, like, ‘Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.’ I finally go, ‘All that’s good, I just need to know, When’s this gonna happen?'”

All right, that’s enough about Leo. How about Roseanne Barr?

Haddish speaks directly into my tape recorder. “I don’t know if you know El Segundo [a coastal California town near LAX], but if you’re black and you’re driving through El Segundo, you’re going to get pulled over. I used to visit my friend Anna there, and it got to a point where I was calling the police officers by name. One day, we were walking around the neighborhood, and Anna says, ‘Oh, Roseanne lives there.’ Now, I loved Roseanne, and the next day we walked by, and she was in her yard. I say, ‘Hiiii, Roseanne.’ She looks at me (makes a disgusted face), and ran in the house. I thought, ‘Maybe she don’t want to be bothered today.’ A week later, we walk by again, and I told Anna — she’s Hispanic, but she looks white — she should say hi this time. So she says, ‘Hi, Roseanne,’ and Roseanne goes, ‘Hey!’ I thought, ‘Maybe she got to know us.’ Then I go back, like, a week later, I wave again and say, ‘Hi, Roseanne! I love your comedy,’ and she (makes the same disgusted face) and turns her head. I think, ‘Fuck that bitch.’ That was 2000, maybe 2001, so it’s not new. She been racist, why’d you all give her a TV show?”

Haddish isn’t done. Somewhere over Nevada, there’s another one about how she tried to take Taylor Swift to her 20-year high school reunion (Swift was game, apparently, but her security shut it down); one about how she almost went on a date with Drake (turns out Joel Edgerton is more her type); and then one she’s told before, about introducing Barbra Streisand to the music of stripper turned rapper Cardi B (“Catchy,” says Haddish, in her best Streisand imitation, “very catchy”). But for all of Haddish’s hilarious stories — and, trust me, there are many more — she also has a serious one to tell.

***

Before that gut-busting turn in Girls Trip, before she parlayed the buzz into a Saturday Night Live hosting gig, a best-selling memoir, a popular stand-up special, the cover of Time 100 and a series of lucrative pacts with practically every major outlet, from Netflix to HBO, Haddish was just a girl from South Central Los Angeles with lofty goals and little means. Her world changed the first time at 8, when her mother suffered a major brain injury in a car accident. After a few months in the hospital, she returned home an angry, abusive version of her former self. Haddish, whose Eritrean immigrant dad had vanished when she was just 3, recalls honing her comedy as a way to make her mother laugh — not to entertain so much as forestall the next outbreak of abuse. It rarely worked for long. “She’d laugh in the moment,” says Haddish, “and then she’d remember why she was mad later and come back and whoop my ass.”

The setup lasted half a decade, and then she and her collection of younger half siblings were tossed into the foster care system and bounced around L.A. At 15, a social worker enrolled Haddish, still barely able to read and a frequent guest in the principal’s office, in a comedy camp at the Laugh Factory. It was that or psychiatric therapy, she says, and praises the program for teaching her as much about stand-up as it did about self-confidence. It was there that she met one of her heroes, Richard Pryor, who gave her a piece of advice that’s stuck with her. “People don’t come to comedy shows because they want to hear about your problems,” she remembers him saying. “They come to comedy shows to have fun, so when you’re onstage, have fun.”

Haddish didn’t see comedy as a full-time career until many years later. First, she made ends meet with side gigs as a pimp, a sex phone operator and an “energy producer” at bar mitzvahs, among other jobs, and on three separate occasions found herself without a place to live. The second time (at 21) and the third (at 24), she slept in her car, a Geo Metro, which she kept parked in Beverly Hills. “If I’m gonna be homeless,” she reasoned, “I’m gonna be homeless in the best area.” There was also a messy marriage and an even messier divorce, though she’s no longer able to discuss it since her ex is suing her over the abuse allegations she lobbed in her memoir.

The Laugh Factory’s Jamie Masada, who attended the wedding, says he still hasn’t shaken the memory he has of Haddish coming into his club with a black eye. “She was crying so much she was gasping for breath,” he says. “The emcee comes over and goes, ‘Tiffany, you’re next,’ and I told him, ‘You gotta put some other comics on first.’ But she says, ‘No, I’m going on, these people paid to see me.'” Masada starts to get emotional. “I’ll never forget it, she went into the bathroom, threw some water on her face, and then went out onstage, and for 30 minutes she made people laugh. There was so much pain inside her, but she didn’t allow any of it to show. In all my years, I’ve never seen anything like it.”

[promo:1118017]

Haddish credits Kevin Hart, another pal from the stand-up circuit, for helping her turn her life around. He famously gave her $300, which she used to put a roof over her head, and told her to make a list of her goals. That list — which included such things as working with Jada Pinkett Smith (check), Whoopi Goldberg (check) and Arsenio Hall (check) — remains in a notebook at her current address, a considerable upgrade from her family’s first but still in South Central L.A. Hart recently joked during a visit to Jimmy Kimmel Live! that Haddish has yet to pay him back, but she says he’s full of it. “I tried to do $50 here, $100 there; once I had the whole $300, he was like, ‘I don’t want that,'” she laughs. “He’s like, ‘Get your car fixed, Tiffany. Why you still in the Geo Metro? Get the fuck out the Geo Metro.'”

With that boost from Hart, acting gigs came slowly but steadily. There was a role on Tyler Perry’s If Loving You Is Wrong, then jobs on The Carmichael Show and Keanu. “You better jump on the Tiffany Haddish train while you can,” she’d tell anyone who’d listen. “It’s movin’ slow now, but it’s about to pick up steam.” In time, its passengers would see Haddish had a talent for establishing intimacy with her audience. “Most artists, when they’re doing their art, they’re onstage, so they’re always a bit above their audience,” says Chris Rock. “But then you got people like Tiffany, who’s literally in the audience — she’s not above them on any level, she’s right there. You feel like she’s sitting with you watching the show.”

Then came Girls Trip. She read the script and recalls thinking, “Oh my God, they just stole my life.” But unlike her co-stars, Queen Latifah, Regina Hall and Pinkett Smith, she had to audition multiple times for the part of supercharged sidekick Dina. For director Malcolm D. Lee, she did so via Skype. “She kept telling me she’d never auditioned this way, but she’d done other things on Skype that she could probably get in trouble for,” recalls Lee; Haddish is more blunt: “I told him I’m only used to sexting on Skype.” Initially, the team was looking for a “name” to round out the quartet, and Haddish, at that time, was not a name. “But we were also looking for somebody to get as close as they could to Dina,” says Packer. “And Tiffany is Dina.”

***

The Monday after Girls Trip opened last July to more than $30 million, Haddish seriously considered changing her number.

In three days, she had logged more than 600 text messages. Some had seen the movie — “[Haddish’s] performance is so good it’s jarring,” raved GQ, as others tried to wedge her into the Oscar race — some the promotional tour, which included a stop on Kimmel, where she famously told the story about taking Will and Jada on a Groupon swamp tour. (She then parlayed the story into a Groupon endorsement deal and, later, a Super Bowl spot.) Pitches, offers and invitations flooded in. In short order, Haddish had pacts with Showtime (for her first comedy special), Netflix (an animated series) and HBO (a first-look deal for her She Ready production company).

There would be major movies, too, but first she had to fulfill the commitments she’d already made, including Tracy Morgan’s TBS series, The Last O.G., and a batch of suddenly sold-out comedy shows. Haddish did the shows somewhat begrudgingly. “I could’ve been paid $80K, probably $90K, a show, but because we booked those before Girls Trip came out, I was getting paid like $20K, $15K, and it fucking sucked,” she says, polishing off her second vodka somewhere over Colorado. “I said to my manager, ‘I think we should just cancel them all, and then if they want to reinstate them, they gotta pay us this much money.’ He’s like, ‘Tiffany, that’s not a good way to do business.’ He said that’s like being a scoundrel, and I was like, ‘No, I’m being a pirate. I want all the booty.'”

The situation on The Last O.G. was more complicated. Haddish says the network tried a few times to go back in and make her character — conceived as a kind of serious, straight-woman — more like Girls Trip‘s Dina, and each time she resisted. She suggests her relationship with Morgan changed, too: “When the Jimmy Kimmel thing came out, he’s like (in Morgan’s voice), ‘I saw you on Jimmy Kimmel, you was nervous as fuck, huh?’ I’m like, ‘No …’ ‘Haddish, come on, I could see it in your eyes, you were scared.’ … But you don’t argue with Tracy, you just say, ‘OK, yeah, you’re right.'”

A few days before we meet, Haddish’s former Carmichael co-star Lil Rel Howery tweeted a link to an interview Morgan had just given, in which he shut down a question about Haddish. Rel included a message to Morgan: “Don’t bite the hand that keeps you relevant!” Haddish says she tried to get her friend to take down the post, but he flat-out refused. “That motherfucker’s a hater,” Rel told her. Other comics reached out, too, and she says she told them all the same thing: “You guys, chill. He’s probably just tired of hearing my name. It’s exhausting. I’m tired of hearing my name. I could see how that could be irritating, like, ‘Hello, I died, people. I’m back from the dead. Tiffany’s cool, but it’s me sitting here now.’ So, I get it, I’m not mad about it, I love me some Tracy.”

Morgan and Haddish are scheduled to go back into production on the series’ second season later this summer. But before that happens, she has to finish The Kitchen, a mob drama for New Line that she’s filming now in New York with Melissa McCarthy and Elisabeth Moss; squeeze in a few more stand-up gigs; shoot at least one more magazine cover; promote another movie she made; and host the MTV awards. She tries out a few monologue ideas on me and then reveals that she’s already enlisted her Girls Trip co-stars and a few more famous friends. For MTV, GM Amy Doyle says the choice of Haddish was easy: “Tiffany’s right in the bull’s-eye of pop culture, and everyone is rooting for her.”

Still, those closest to Haddish worry that she may be pushing herself too hard — she says she hasn’t figured out how to ride the wave any other way. Right now, she merely fantasizes about what a day free of professional responsibilities might look like. “I’d wake up,” she muses, “smoke a little weed, have a sip of vodka, eat some food, go back to sleep, wake up again, turn on some cartoons, take a poop, smoke a little more weed, have some water, go back to sleep.” There’s no reference to a relationship because, she insists, there’s not time for one of those either. Her most recent one ended in August, when she realized her boyfriend was trying to take control of her career. The last straw? When she arrived at what she thought would be an intimate dinner to discover he had invited a record executive to discuss a business opportunity. She called it quits that night, and, she tells me, her “coochie’s been closed ever since.”

***

We’re high above Illinois when Haddish orders her third and final vodka. “I’d take a foot massage, too,” she jokes to a gaggle of star-struck flight attendants.

Haddish is getting more comfortable with the wide-eyed, “Oh my God, it’s really you!” look, which she’s been seeing a lot of lately. Before Girls Trip came out, Pinkett Smith told her she’d know she had made it when people started calling her by her character’s name. But already Haddish has done one better: they see her now and call her by her own name. I witnessed it as we made our way through the San Francisco airport earlier in the day, though it should be noted that Haddish makes no pains to slip by unnoticed. On this afternoon, she wore a camo jacket with the word “Queen” etched in big block letters over a t-shirt with her personal motto, “She Ready,” splashed across her chest. Hanging in both ears were chunky gold hoops with “Tiffany” written in cursive within.

Each time a photo of Haddish is snapped — and she willingly poses for many — she repeats the word, “Success.” Ambition is nothing to be coy about, she says, and she lives her life accordingly. Ask her what she’d like to do with her new platform, and she offers a laundry list: “I want to make a cookbook. I wanna make a gardening book. I want a clothing line. I want a jewelry line. I want a perfume.” You get the sense she’d keep going if you’d let her, and so you do. “And then I want to buy two streets that intersect, Tiffany and Haddish, and I’m gonna build a big youth center, a mental health center, I might do some transitional housing, too. But I’m gonna own it. And I’m gonna have music and all the other stuff they’re taking out of schools. Right now, my mind’s on one street, but it might be in every city, every metropolis, and it might turn into a big thing. It’s gonna be amazing.”

As for Hollywood, she says she’d like to make at least 50 movies by the time she turns 50, which, if you’re counting, is only 12 years away. “And I want to get $10 million a movie,” she says, “$100 million, eventually.” Predictably, Haddish has plenty of new “friends,” eager to poach her from her longtime reps at APA and Artists First — some of them have even lavished her with gifts, including a custom pair of “She Ready” Gucci slippers. Her response is usually a version of, “Thanks, and I’d love to work with any of your clients, but until my agents mess up and do something really destructive to my career, I’m not goin’ anywhere.”

Presented with a candy shop of career options, Haddish seems to be relying less on a long-term strategy than gut instinct about roles that feel right and creative people she wants to work with, like Carmichael showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzel. The women are quietly prepping a sitcom vehicle for Haddish about the life of female comedians. Two episodes already have been written, but it’s yet to be shopped. If all goes as planned, Haddish will also tape a stand-up special for Netflix in the fall and adapt her memoir into a film. Judd Apatow approached her with the idea, and the two now are trying to get on the same page. She’s committed to making it work, she’s just not so sure she wants to revisit those early years. “I don’t wanna watch that shit,” she says. “I wrote it to get it off my chest and let it go.”

[promo:1120494]

Nearer term, she’ll star opposite Hart in Universal’s September comedy Night School and Ike Barinholtz in his directorial debut, The Oath. Barinholtz had caught Haddish first in Keanu, and Jordan Peele told him if he could get her in his thriller, he should. “She was definitely everyone’s favorite person on the movie,” Barinholtz says now — and not just because she invited them to tag along to DJ Khaled’s birthday party. “It’s also because she says exactly what’s on her mind and she loves to mess with people. Like, you’d ask for a take, and she’d look right into the camera lens, and she’d start talking to the editor: ‘Yo, Jack, that scene was a good one for me. I think you should really take a look.’ You just fall in love with her.”

***

With roughly two hours left in our flight, I broach the topic of Beyonce. In case you missed it, and at this point it’s hard to imagine you could have, Haddish recently told an insane story about a private party she’d been at where an actress bit the pop star’s face. The mystery of “Who Bit Beyonce?” all but broke the internet.

Haddish asks whether I know who did it, and I whisper the name that’s been rumored: Sanaa Lathan. She smiles. “I’m super good friends with her stepmom and her dad [Stan, a producer-director], and they were mad at me,” she reveals. “They were like, ‘Why would you do this to the family? You know, black actresses, you guys have to stick together, it’s so hard for you guys to get work as it is, why would you try to ruin her career?’ But I didn’t try to ruin her career. I never said her name! I was just trying to say how Beyonce kept me from goin’ to jail that night. I coulda just shut my whole career down.”

I wonder aloud if there’s been any other fallout, and she insists no, just the opposite. “The other day, someone was saying, like, ‘Oh my God, you should keep your mouth shut ’cause now you’re never gonna be invited to parties,’ but I got invited to way more parties after that,” she tells me. “It’s ridiculous how many parties. ‘Can you come to my party?’ ‘Can you come to my thing?’ They want me to talk about something at their thing ’cause they think, like, ‘This is gonna put me back on if Tiffany says something.'” If only Tiffany Haddish had time to party more.

And at that, we agree to turn off the tape recorder and let her get some rest. She flips on a movie, Thor: Ragnarok, but can’t resist turning to me to discuss the genetic gifts that are the Hemsworth brothers and how she’d love to work with — she can’t quite summon Anthony Hopkins’ name — “the guy from Sleeping With the Lambs.” We both burst into laughter. “I guess I’m pretty tired,” she says. “And tipsy.” Then she reclines her seat, pulls a blanket over her body and promptly passes out.

"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner Officially File for Divorce: 'It Was Just Time,' Says Source",https://people.com/celebrity/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-divorce/,people.com,2,1,"Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have filed for divorce nearly two years after the couple originally announced their split, PEOPLE confirms.

Garner and Affleck filed the docs together and they are both seeking joint legal and physical custody of their three kids. The date of separation, as well as the division of property and any spousal support, is still to be determined.

The divorce filing was originally reported by TMZ.

The former couple filed mirror-image paperwork and they each filed “in propria persona” — which means without an on-the-record attorney. Both Affleck and Garner noted that they will keep any earnings they made since they separated, so the separation date they determine could affect the settlement. They announced their split on June 30, 2015.

A source tells PEOPLE the filing is “super amicable.”

A separate source adds, “They always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce not separate. They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.”

Affleck and Garner have been in mediation and are working with leading L.A. divorce attorney Laura Wasser, according to another source. Wasser has handled divorce cases of several A-listers including Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Kim Kardashian.

Affleck and Garner broke off their 10-year marriage in June of 2015, telling PEOPLE in a joint statement, “After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.”

Over the following months, Garner and Affleck, both 44, sometimes sparked reconciliation rumors as they continued to live together, vacation together and co-parent their kids — Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, almost 5 — while also stepping out for solo outings.

The friendly exes have been spotted out frequently during the last few months, including a sighting on Election Day in L.A. where they were both seen wearing “I Voted” stickers after casting their ballots. The actors also spent the holidays together with their kids in Montana, with a source telling PEOPLE they “seemed to have a great time.”

Affleck called Garner the “world’s greatest mom” at a TimesTalk in New York in mid-December while saying that the births of their children were the most defining moments of his life. “It’s a joy to hang out with them,” he added. “I think the meaning of life is to make good people.”

“They are co-parenting the best they can,” a source who knows both of them told PEOPLE. “Whatever incarnation of a relationship this is works for them.”

After completing rehab for alcohol addiction earlier this month, Affleck has been enjoying spending time with the kids. In fact, the morning after he announced he had completed rehab, things were business as usual as he was spotted taking his kids to school with Garner. A source told PEOPLE that the actor is relishing time with his children.

“Ben is spending special time with all the kids separately,” the source said. “He seems very happy. The mood in general seems very upbeat. The kids are thrilled that he is back.”"

Musuamba Michoukayembe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, went into labour three hours into a flight from the Gabonese capital, Libreville, to Turkey's biggest city Istanbul.

The 21-year-old's husband,who is a doctor, and the cabin crew immediately began preparing for the birth, isolating an area at the back of the Turkish Airlines plane.

Ms Michoukayembe gave birth to a healthy baby boy, named Bennel, some 42,650 feet (13,000 metres) above the Republic of Niger in north-western Africa.

Pilot Alper Akkaya said: 'The cabin crew established the necessary co-ordination and the baby was born after a healthy delivery. Fortunately, his father was a doctor, he helped us a lot.'

He revealed he had requested a priority landing, as well as an ambulance and doctors, shortly before entering Turkish airspace.

Mr Akkaya added: 'We completed this beautiful event in a healthy way. If it had not been a healthy birth, we would have diverted to another airport. But since it was healthy, we continued our four-hour flight.'

When the plane touched down in Istanbul, the new parents and the baby were taken to the nearest hospital in the Yesilkoy neighbourhood of the city.

The healthy baby boy, named Bennel, was born above the Republic of Niger in north-western Africa with the help of his doctor father and the cabin crew

Purser Fatma Akyuz said it had been an exciting flight: 'We boarded with 144 passengers, but landed with 145 passengers. It was a beautiful moment for us,' she said.

Cabin crew member Ilayda Erhalac said the pregnant woman had been quiet and relaxed during takeoff but had gone into labour three hours later.

She said: 'We prepared for the birth of our newest friend in a matter of minutes. We dealt with it professionally and everything turned out well.'"

From social media missives to statements from publicists, everyone was excited to be embraced by the Television Academy.

Comedian Tiffany Haddish, who was nominated for her work hosting “Saturday Night Live,” slyly suggested that she might buy a new dress for the occasion. (Does that mean she’s retiring that famous Alexander McQueen dress she got plenty of use out of during last awards season?)

Bishop Michael Curry Gave Outline of Royal Wedding Sermon,http://time.com/5286900/bishop-michael-curry-good-morning-america/,time.com,48,1,"The Bishop who captivated the world with powerful, nearly 14-minute sermon at the royal wedding on Saturday said he gave an “outline” of his sermon to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a week ahead of the event.

“They were very gracious. I did provide a copy of the manuscript about a week before, I think it was,” Presiding Bishop Michael Curry told Robin Roberts on ABC’s Good Morning America Tuesday. “I only deviated slightly. You can’t get a preacher — you’re going to deviate a little bit.”

He added: “They were aware of the basic outline and what was in it.”

Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joins us LIVE in Times Square, going one-on-one with @RobinRoberts following his show-stopping sermon on ""the power of love"" at the #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/l5NmX8LhBY — Good Morning America (@GMA) May 22, 2018

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex selected Curry, the first African American presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, to deliver the sermon at their May 19 wedding at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. They chose Curry after consulting with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the dean of St. George’s Chapel, Curry told Good Morning America. When he got the phone call from the Archbishop’s Lambeth Palace informing him of their decision, he couldn’t believe it.

“I said, ‘Get out of here. It’s April Fools. You gotta be kidding,'” he said. “And it was actually true.”

A month later, when he was finally able to tell his wife the news, she had the same, stunned reaction, he said.

Born in Chicago, Curry said he has had a “remarkable and very surprising” last few days after his sermon on the power of love enchanted the world. He took a selfie with the crew on his American Airlines flight back to the U.S., he said, and Keenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live did an impression of him on the show’s “Weekend Update” segment that night.

“It was a great likeness,” Curry said of the S.N.L. impression. “I can’t believe they actually pulled it off just in a matter of hours.”

He told Roberts that the clear love between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle inspired his sermon — and notably brought together a diverse group of people for the ceremony.

“The love between those two people, between that royal couple, was so powerful, not only did we all show up, but it brought all these different worlds together,” he said. “It brought different nationalities, different ethnicities, different religious traditions, people of all stripes and types, people of different political persuasions, actually for a moment we were together, organized around love.”"

Rod Stewart says Elton John's farewell tour is 'dishonest' and 'stinks of selling tickets',https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/22/rod-stewart-says-elton-johns-farwell-tour-dishonest-stinks-selling/,www.telegraph.co.uk,93,1,"Rod Stewart has criticised Elton John's retirement tour and branded it a ""dishonest"" ploy to make money.

The Maggie May singer said he didn't believe in retirement tours, and that the 300 date 'Farewell Yellow Brick Road' world tour ""stinks of selling tickets"".

Stewart, 73, said that he has never talked about retiring and that the decision by Elton, 70, was ""not rock and roll"".

Stewart was in a jocular mood during an appearance on a US chat show when asked about Elton, who has been friends with for 50 years. But his comments about retirement seemed rather more pointed.

Stewart was appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when a fan called in to ask him what he thought of The Rocket Man's planned retirement.

Stewart said: ""I did email her [Elton] and said: 'What, again dear?' And I didn't hear anything back."

Kate, 35, was her usual elegant self in a pristine white coat by Alexander McQueen. She carried Charlotte in her arms and expertly navigated the plane steps in her favourite nude high heels, while William held onto three-year-old Prince George, who at first seemed reluctant to disembark from the plane. This is William and Kate's first official joint trip to Poland and Germany; the Duke, also 35, made an official visit to Germany last summer.

Earlier this year, the Duke and Duchess spent two days in Paris where they met former French President Francois Hollande.

Kevin Spacey will not receive international Emmy after allegation of sexual advance on 14-year-old,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-spacey-receive-international-emmy-allegation-sexual-advance/story?id=50832824,abcnews.go.com,52,1,"Kevin Spacey will not receive international Emmy after allegation of sexual advance on 14-year-old

— -- Kevin Spacey will no longer be honored by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences at its upcoming awards gala following actor Anthony Rapp's allegation that, when he was just 14, the ""House of Cards"" star made a sexual advance on him.

The International Academy made the announcement Monday night on its website.

""The International Academy has announced today that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award,"" a statement read.

Calling the two-time Oscar winner ""one of the great multi-dimensional talents in our industry,"" the International Academy first announced in June that Spacey was set to accept its Founders Award, which recognizes individuals who cross cultural boundaries.

On Sunday, Rapp, now 46, accused Spacey of trying to seduce him while attending a party back in 1986.

""He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?' And then he lays down on top of me,"" Rapp said in a BuzzFeed article published Sunday.

Spacey, who said he doesn't remember the incident, nonetheless apologized for his ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior"" in a post on Twitter later that night. In his tweet, he also revealed that he has ""loved and had romantic encounters with men"" and that he chooses ""now to live as a gay man.""

Despite his apology, which was widely criticized for his coming out under these circumstances, the producers of his Netflix show ""House of Cards"" announced today that they were suspending production on the show.

""MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on HOUSE OF CARDS season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,"" Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio that created ""House of Cards"" with the streaming service, said in a joint statement.

On Monday, the producers said they were meeting with the cast and crew to ""ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported,"" adding that ""Spacey is not working on the set at this time.""

Joe Giudice (Real Housewives of New Jersey): I don't think that Teresa Giudice is blameless in the Giudice couple being convicted for bankruptcy and bank fraud, but anyone who has watched the show knows that Joe was up to some shady business. There's nothing dreamy about going to prison for a year because of your man.

52. Kelsey Grammer (Real Housewives of Beverly Hills): Yes, that Kelsey Grammer, star of Cheers and Frasier, was briefly on the first season of this show before unceremoniously divorcing his wife Camille and then refusing to talk to her. Though whenever he was onscreen with St. Camille of Grammer, as she came to be known, he hardly seemed interested in being near her. At least she got a boatload of money for her trouble.

51. David Foster (RHOBH): As soon as Yolanda Hadid Foster got sick with Lyme disease, you just had a feeling that the smarmy Grammy-winner and serial reality-television participant was going to dump his fourth wife. Then he did.

50. Josh Taekman(Real Housewives of New York): No one really liked the condescending (though admittedly handsome) entrepreneur and serial bad-hat-wearer before he got caught in the Ashley Madison hacking scandal. Now we think that former Housewife Kristen is crazy for staying with him.

49. Kordell Stewart (Real Housewives of Atlanta): Sure, it wasn't nice of Porsha Williams to spread rumors about her ex's sexual orientation after he divorced her following one season on the show and two years of marriage.

Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are electric on screen together in the Oscar-worthy 'A Star Is Born',https://www.businessinsider.com/bradley-cooper-lady-gaga-a-star-is-born-review-2018-9,www.businessinsider.com,40,1,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga make an electric combination in ""A Star Is Born.""

Cooper even does his own singing the movie's songs alongside Gaga.

The movie, which Cooper also directed, definitely lives up to the hype and will be an Oscar contender.



Going all the way back to 1937, Hollywood has been in love with the rags to riches story of “A Star Is Born.”

The movie that follows the overnight success of an aspiring singer has been done by the likes of Judy Garland (in the 1954 version) and Barbara Streisand (1976), and now Lady Gaga has added her name to the roster.

We know Gaga for her incredible singing and stage persona, but for at least the rest of this year she'll also be lauded for her acting abilities. She's incredible as Ally, who is discovered by the singer-songwriter Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper), who mentors her into a superstar. The two eventually also fall in love.

And if Gaga's acting ability comes as a surprise, get ready for another — Bradley Cooper can direct (wait for it...) and sing!

""A Star Is Born,"" which opens in theaters October 5, marks the actor’s directorial debut and he crushes it as he weaves together a story filled with emotion and heartache about love, ego, stardom, and acceptance.

Following the 1976 rock-and-roll musical version, which was nominated for four Oscars and won for best original song, the project was looking to be told once again in a modern setting. Names like Clint Eastwood were floated as a potential director, and Beyoncé, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith were all rumored to star over the years, but for the most part the project lingered in development hell. But in 2016 it was announced that Cooper had signed on to not just star but also direct and the project was on the fast track, nabbing Gaga along the way.

The movie is fueled by the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who performed many of the songs featured in the movie in front of live audiences. Cooper holds his own in the singing department and brings a lot of empathy to his drug and alcohol-addicted rocker character with a troubled past. But it's watching Gaga belt out the ballads with ferocious intensity that will give you goosebumps.

Along for the ride is Sam Elliott, who plays Bobby, Jackson's older brother and the one person who has looked out for him his whole life as their father was a drunk. Cooper gives Jackson a deep, twangy voice that's almost spot on to how Elliott talks, which just adds fuel to the authentic feel of the brothers' love-hate-relationship.

In the other versions of this movie, much of the focus is on the female character. But in this one, the pulse is Jackson, whose self-destructive life only brings Ally closer to him, until finally it's too much for her to handle. The last third of the movie is heart-wrenching to watch, but you can't turn away as Cooper delivers a tour-de-force performance that will certainly garner him an Oscar nomination.

In fact, there might be a lot of Oscar notice for this movie. Along with Gaga and Elliott's top-notch work, the original songs are fantastic, and the editing flawlessly delivered the fast-moving lifestyle the two main characters live.

The hype for this movie is already through the roof, and all I can say is it lives up to it."

Teen Mom 2 Star Kailyn Lowry Welcomes Baby No. 3,https://people.com/celebrity/kailyn-lowry-teen-mom-star-welcomes-baby-3/,people.com,2,1,"Teen Mom 2‘s Kailyn Lowry is a new mom again!

The reality TV star has welcomed her third child, a boy, she confirmed on Twitter.

On Saturday, Lowry shared a RadarOnline report about her giving birth and later tweeted “Mother of boys.”

The 25-year-old MTV star revealed in a February blog post that she was expecting her third child, then confirmed on May 2 that the baby’s father is her friend Chris Lopez.

Lowry is already parents to Isaac Elliot, 7 (whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera) and son Lincoln Marshall, 3 (whom she shares with ex-husband Javi Marroquin). And it seems the boys are excited about welcoming a new sibling too.

“Lincoln really just asked if I could open my belly so he could see the baby,” Lowry tweeted in May.

The star, who graduated college in May, admitted earlier this year that she was nervous bout her third journey to motherhood.

“This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,” she wrote in the February blog post. “And like I say in my book — with a little bit of hustle heart, I can and I will survive anything.”

She added, “Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can’t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.”

Although the baby’s sex was unknown in the weeks leading up to the birth, Lowry revealed her wishes in a May 11 tweet, writing, “I bought baby bows today … JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.”

Porsha Williams Still Wears Her Wedding Ring from Ex Kordell Stewart: 'It's Costume Jewelry',https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/,people.com,23,1,"It’s been four years since Porsha Williams and her ex-husband Kordell Stewart ended their marriage, but the Real Housewives of Atlanta star is still wearing her wedding ring from time to time.

On Sunday’s episode, Williams’ sister Lauren called her out on it, saying, “Oh my God, you’re wearing it like it’s costume jewelry.”

“It is costume jewelry!” the 36-year-old Dish Nation host responded. “It’s mine. And it’s a diamond!”

Williams, who was married to Stewart for two years before their divorce in 2013, may be rocking her old ring, but she’s very much single. Earlier this month, she told PEOPLE that fans will see her dating on this season of the show — though it’s just “not as much of a priority of mine as it’s seemed in the past.”

“I absolutely know myself more today than I did when I was married” she said when asked what she’s looking for in a man. “For me, it’s about finding someone who wants to be part of your world and who is supportive of you and who understands that if it ends up being a serious relationship, you’ll make those adjustments to prioritize a happy family first.”

“I don’t regret anything because anything I’ve been through just helps build who I am today — be it relationships with me or friendships, it all helps shape who you become. But I definitely say I’m a different person, and I’m supposed to be,” she said. “It’s a good thing.”

The other major change for Williams is that she’s cooled her jets on her quest for motherhood, something she attributes to time spent with her 1½-year-old niece Baleigh.

“Every time I’m around my niece, she gives me baby fever. But that’s the thing about baby fever. You have it, and then you get well again,” Williams said. “I’m okay right now. I’m not going to have a baby until I’ve found that right guy. And I’m sure once I find him, that’ll be one of the first things we do.”

“For me, I’ve thought of a lot of creative ways I can make that happen without a man. Once I realized it doesn’t have to be one way, then it gave me a little more time,” she continued. “So I’m not obsessing over it anymore.”

In a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit over the weekend, ""Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot joined openly gay ""SNL"" cast member Kate McKinnon in a parody of the hit franchise — and a play on the rampant speculation that the film's title character is less-than-heterosexual.

McKinnon and fellow ""SNL"" cast member Aidy Bryant play two self-identified lesbians, Megan and Dre, who are lost at sea and dock their boat on the fictional island nation of Themyscira. The island, home to Wonder Woman, is inhabited solely by women.

“I guess I’ll cut to the chase,"" McKinnon's character says. ""Show of hands: Who all here is a lez?""

When none of the island's inhabitants raise their hands, McKinnon's character shares the frustration of many of the film's fans, exclaiming, ""The whole thing seemed so super gay.""

Prince Charles will walk Markle down the aisle

Prince Charles will walk Markle from the quire, the area of St. George’s Chapel where the clergy and choir sit, to Harry. The procession in the nave, the central part of the church, will include Markle, the Dean of Windsor and Markle’s bridesmaids and page boys.

Markle originally asked her dad, Thomas Markle Sr., to walk her down the aisle but chose her soon-to-be father-in-law after her father became unable to attend the wedding.

Markle, 36, confirmed in a statement that her dad, who lives in Mexico, will not attend the wedding due to health concerns.

Who's who in the wedding party

Markle will not have a maid of honor by her side, as she did not want to single out one of her close circle of friends, sources told ABC News.

She will though have bridesmaids and page boys, all children, by her side at her wedding.

William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage at the wedding as a page boy and bridesmaid, respectively.

Also joining Charlotte and George in the wedding party will be the three children of Markle's best friend, entrepreneur and style adviser Jessica Mulroney.

Ivy Mulroney, 4, will serve as a bridesmaid, while her older brothers, 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney, will join George as page boys.

Also serving as a page boy will be Jasper Dyer, the 6-year-old son of Harry's mentor and close friend, Capt. Mark Dyer.

Joining Charlotte and Ivy as bridesmaids will be two of Harry's goddaughters -- 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren -- and two of Markle's goddaughters, 7-year-old Rylan Litt and her 6-year-old sister, Remi Litt.

William will serve as best man on May 19, just as Harry served as best man at William and Kate's wedding in 2011.

Who will design Markle's dress?

A top contender for designing Markle's gown is the design duo behind Ralph & Russo.

Australian-born designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo drew the spotlight when Markle chose their jaw-dropping $75,000 gown for her engagement photos with Harry last December.

Other possibilities for the coveted design assignment have included Christopher Bailey, the visionary behind the iconic British brand Burberry, British designer Stella McCartney, Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, and Roland Mouret, a close friend of Markle's.

Designer Roland Mouret and actress Meghan Markle attend the Roland Mouret private dinner at Corkin Gallery on April 28, 2016 in Toronto.

British designer Victoria Beckham, whose sweater Markle wore in her engagement photos with Harry, has denied she is creating Markle's dress.

""Sadly not, but I'm sure she will look incredible in whatever she wears,"" Beckham said on the April 12th episode of CBS' ""The Late Late Show With James Corden.""

Markle had her first fitting with the unnamed designer in January at Kensington Palace, royal reporter Omid Scobie told ABC News at the time.

Markle's mom's important role

Markle’s mom, Doria Ragland, is expected to be the only member of her family attending the wedding. She will accompany Markle by car from her overnight location to Windsor Castle on the day of the wedding.

Meghan Markle and mother Doria Ragland attend the Closing Ceremony on day 8 of the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 on Sept. 30, 2017 in Toronto.

Ragland, a Los Angeles-based yoga instructor and social worker, has spent the days before the wedding meeting Harry’s royal relatives and Harry and Markle’s closest friends in the U.K.

Princess Diana's sentimental influence

Princess Diana's memory will be kept alive at the wedding through the presence of her three siblings.

Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister, will deliver the reading at the wedding.

Both Markle and Harry have said how important it is that Harry's late mother be included in their wedding.

""I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me,"" Harry said when his engagement to Markle was announced. ""But then, as I said, [she] would've probably been best friends with Meghan.""

Markle's engagement ring features two diamonds from Diana's personal collection.

""The little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,"" Harry said in November.

Location, location, location

Harry and Markle will wed at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle, about 22 miles outside of London.

St. George's Chapel is a smaller venue than Westminster Abbey, where Prince William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, and St. Paul's Cathedral, where Prince Charles and Diana wed in 1981.

The chapel, which can seat 800 people, is where Harry was baptized in 1984. It is also where Harry's father, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, held a service of prayer and dedication at the chapel in 2005 following their marriage at Guild Hall.

The last royal wedding to be held at St. George's Chapel was a decade ago, when Peter Phillips wed Autumn Kelly in May 2008, according to the chapel's website.

Where Harry and Markle will stay

The couple will stay at separate hotels on the eve of their wedding.

Harry will be joined by his best man, William, at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park. Markle and her mother will stay at Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust's Cliveden Estate, according to Kensington Palace.

Wedding day lineup

The wedding will begin at noon local time, 7 a.m., ET, on May 19.

The Right Rev. David Conner, the dean of Windsor, will conduct the wedding service. The Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who baptized and confirmed Markle, will officiate when the couple takes their marriage vows.

The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, will give the address at the wedding.

Harry and William will arrive by foot, entering through the chapel's west steps and walking past the crowds gathered outside the chapel on their way in.

Markle will also enter the chapel through the west steps, joined by some of the bridesmaids and page boys.

Following the hour-long wedding ceremony, the couple will meet in the chapel's Horseshoe Cloisterwith with 200 representatives of charities for which Harry has served as patron.

Harry and Markle plan to undertake a carriage procession that will start at St. George's Chapel, leave Windsor Castle via Castle Hill, continue along High Street through Windsor Town before returning to Windsor Castle on a route called the Long Walk.

They will be waved off on their carriage ride by members of the Royal Family. The guests at the wedding service will observe the sendoff of the carriage procession.

After the carriage procession, the newlyweds will attend a lunchtime reception, hosted by Queen Elizabeth, at St. George's Hall, where they will rejoin their wedding guests.

In the evening, a smaller group of 200 guests will attend a reception hosted by Harry’s father, Prince Charles, at Frogmore House.

Frogmore House, also on the grounds of Windsor Castle, is the location Markle and Harry chose for their intimate engagement photos released by Kensington Palace in December.

Both receptions will be closed to the public but there may be a second glimpse of Markle and Harry when they depart Windsor Castle for Frogmore House in the evening.

The wedding cake's California connection

Harry and Markle selected pastry chef Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, East London, to design their wedding cake.

Ptak, like Markle, was raised in California before moving to London. Her bakery is notable for using seasonal and organic ingredients in cakes.

Ptak is creating a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream icing and fresh flowers as decorations, according to Kensington Palace.

The choice of a lemon elderflower cake is a departure from the royal tradition of serving British fruit cake on the wedding day.

William and Kate had two cakes on their wedding day in 2011, a traditional eight-tier fruit cake created by chef Fiona Cairns and a chocolate biscuit cake from a beloved Buckingham Palace recipe.

See the gilded wedding invitations

Roughly 600 invitations to Harry and Markle's wedding have been issued, Kensington Palace announced in late March.

The invitations are printed in gold and black on English card using American ink, a process that some saw as a nod to Markle's American roots.

Issued “in the name of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales,"" each invitation is accented with gilded edges and features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales, according to Kensington Palace. The names of invited guests were added by a calligraphy printer.

Lubomirski, a renowned portrait and fashion photographer, will take the official photographs at Windsor Castle following Harry and Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel.

Lubomirski is a former assistant to Mario Testino, who was a favorite photographer of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana.

He was also selected by Harry and Markle to take their engagement photos at Frogmore House, Windsor, that were released by Kensington Palace in December.

Markle's favorite bloom in the wedding flowers

The wedding floral displays in St. George's Chapel will include white garden roses foxgloves and peonies, Markle’s favorite bloom, as well as local branches of beech, birch, and hornbeam.

Markle and Harry have chosen Philippa Craddock to design the flowers for both the church service at St. George’s Chapel and the wedding reception at St. George’s Hall hosted by Queen Elizabeth.

Craddock, based in Fulham, is one of the most notable florists in London, with clients including Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Vogue.

The flowers -- which will also include locally-sourced foliage from areas around Windsor Castle -- will be donated to various charities after the wedding, according to Kensington Palace.

The soundtrack of the wedding

Harry and Markle's wedding day will be illuminated by the sounds of a gospel choir, an organ, trumpets, a full orchestra, a soprano and a 19-year-old cellist who was personally asked by Markle.

""I was bowled over when Ms. Markle called me to ask if I would play during the ceremony,"" Sheku Kanneh-Mason said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. ""And of course I immediately said yes. What a privilege to be able to play the cello at such a wonderful event. I can’t wait!”

The music during the wedding ceremony will be under the direction of St. George's Chapel's director of music, James Vivian, and will also include the choir of St. George's Chapel, according to Kensington Palace.

The entire ceremony will also be recorded live and released on Decca Records, a U.K.-based records label. The album, which will include a collector's booklet, will go on sale around the world on May 25, according to Decca Records.

Harry and Markle's horse-drawn royal carriage

The newlyweds will travel through Windsor Town and along the Long Walk in the Ascot Landau carriage.

The carriage, which will be pulled by Windsor Grey horses, is one of five Ascot Landaus used by the royal family. Two of the Ascot Landaus were used at William and Kate's 2011 wedding, including carrying Harry in his role as best man.

The most celeb-studded royal wedding to date?

Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding are some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra and tennis star Serena Williams.

Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will not be at the wedding at Windsor Castle, despite speculation they would attend. It is unclear whether the Obamas received an invitation but declined to avoid a political distraction.

Markle and Harry decided against inviting political leaders from the U.K. and abroad to their wedding, meaning President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will not attend.

Markle has though invited several members of the cast of ""Suits,"" the TV show she starred on for seven seasons, ABC News has learned. Also expected to attend the wedding ceremony is Elton John, one of Diana’s closest friends who has worked with Harry on AIDs policy.

Singers Ed Sheeran and Rihanna and members of Coldplay, who have all actively supported Harry's charitable work, could also get invites.

Spice Girls star Mel B said on a talk show in February that all five Spice Girls have been invited to Harry and Markle's wedding.

Mel B declined to comment on whether the Spice Girls would perform on the big day, saying, ""You’re going to get me fired! Let’s not talk about it anymore! Let’s pretend that I never said that.”

Other members of the girl band have since indicated they will not be performing.

Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.

Everyday people will play a role

Harry and Markle have invited 2,640 people onto the grounds of Windsor Castle to see the wedding carriage procession as it departs.

Meghan Markle and Britain's Prince Harry are greeted by flag waving school children as they arrive to take part in an event for young women as part of International Women's Day in Birmingham, central England, March 8, 2018.

Members of the public were selected from different regions of the U.K. with a special emphasis on those who have served their community. The couple also invited 100 students from two local schools in Windsor that have a strong affiliation with Windsor Castle.

Harry and Markle also extended invitations to 200 individuals who take part in charities and organizations for which Harry serves as royal patron.

Armed Forces will play a role too

More than 250 members of the Armed Forces will provide ceremonial support at both the wedding and the carriage procession, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.

""Members of the Household Cavalry will form a staircase party at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle as part of the wedding,"" the statement reads. ""The State Trumpeters and a Captain’s Escort from the Household Cavalry will also provide ceremonial support.""

The members will come from British Armed Forces units with a “special relationship” to Harry, a veteran. Harry served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and rose to the rank of Captain during his time in the military.

Is Markle planning this all on her own?

Markle's best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, is also a bridal planner and assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.

Jessica Mulroney and actress Meghan Markle attend the World Vision event held at Lumas Gallery, March 22, 2016, in Toronto.

Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist who styled Markle during her seven-season run on the TV drama ""Suits,"" which films in Toronto.

Since Markle's engagement to Harry, Mulroney helped select the dress and coat Markle wore on the day the couple's engagement was announced in November. Mulroney was also at Markle's side advising her on the gown and sweater Markle wore for her intimate engagement photos with Harry.

Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The two are one of Canada's best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.

Who is paying for this celebration?

Kensington Palace confirmed in a statement released after the couple’s engagement that Harry’s family would pay for the “core aspects of the wedding.”

""As was the case with the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Royal Family will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations, and the reception afterwards,” the statement read.

Markle is expected to pay for her wedding dress. Security costs for the wedding day will come at the expense of U.K. taxpayers.

Queen Elizabeth gives handwritten, formal consent

Buckingham Palace shared an image of the handwritten Instrument of Consent. According to the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, the first six people in line to the throne must obtain the consent of the Queen before marrying.

A design to the left of the text on the Instrument of Consent “incorporates a red dragon, the heraldic symbol of Wales, together with the U.K.'s floral emblems -- the rose, thistle and shamrock. It also features Prince Harry’s label, including three tiny red escallops from the Spencer family arms,"" according to Buckingham Palace.

To the right of the text is a rose, which is the national flower of the United States, and two golden poppies, the state flower of California where Markle was born. Between the flowers is the Welsh leek, together with Harry’s label. Beneath the label are olive branches, adopted from the Great Seal of the United States. The document also incorporates the coronet for Harry.

The honeymoon will be delayed

Harry and Markle will delay their honeymoon and do a public engagement the week after the wedding.

The newlyweds will attend Prince Charles's 70th birthday patronage celebration at Buckingham Palace on May 22, just days after their wedding.

Markle and Harry will take a honeymoon sometime thereafter, before resuming a busy schedule of engagements for the rest of the year.

The couple will not do any public engagements between now and their wedding day."

About 50 other concertgoers were injured in the attack, according to Manchester police. U.S. security officials told The Washington Post that evidence suggested a suicide bombing. The explosion occurred outside the venue, just as Grande finished the show and people started to leave the arena.

Grande’s manager, Scooter Braun, also released a statement on Twitter: “Words cannot express our sorrow for the victims and families harmed in this senseless attack.

We are thankful for the selfless service tonight of Manchester’s first responders who rushed toward danger to help save lives.

NEW YORK, June 9, 2013— -- A rush transcript of ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" airing on Sunday morning, June 9, 2013 on ABC News is below. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to ""This Week."" Watching everything.

(START VIDEO CLIP)

SAWYER: America's phone records, but also internet searches are under surveillance.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: A secret government program tracking our phones, casting a wide net across the internet.

(START VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: I want to be very clear, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Has this protected national security?

(START VIDEO CLIP)

ROGERS: This program was used to stop a terrorist attack.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: At what cost to personal privacy?

(START VIDEO CLIP)

PAUL: I am appalled. It's a violation of the Bill of Rights.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we cover the controversy from all angles. The reporter who broke the story, Glen Greenwald. The Senator who sounded the alarm, Mark Udall, and the Committee Chairs who approved the program, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Congressman Mike Rogers. Plus our Powerhouse Roundtable on that, and all the weeks politics with ABC's George Will and Matthew Dowd, Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman from the New York Times, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Great Van Susteren from Fox News.

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.

And our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?

GREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.

So what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies. Your response to that?"
Kate Middleton Takes More Serious Role By Hosting Round Table Discussion About Maternal Mental Health,https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a39697/kate-middleton-hosts-round-table-discussion-maternal-mental-health/,www.elle.com,25,1,"Days after practicing her serve at a Tennis for Kids session, the Duchess of Cambridge has hosted a private meeting at Kensington Palace to seriously tackle the issue of mental health for new mums.

Yesterday, the pregnant royal was photographed by the Kensington Palace Twitter page discussing maternal mental health with some 12 guests including members from Maternal Mental Health Alliance, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Kings College and Best Beginnings.

Kensington Palace shared a picture of the mother-of-two discussing health issues and tweeted:

The palace went onto explain that at least 20 per cent of women are affected by mental health problems during pregnancy or in the first year following the birth of a child.

The Duchess - who was the brainchild of mental health campaign Heads Together with her husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry - has spoken openly about her own struggles with the isolation of motherhood following the birth of her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

Speaking with mothers during a meeting at the Global Academy earlier this year, the pregnant mum admitted to a group of mothers: 'It is lonely at times and you do feel quite isolated, but actually so many other mothers are going through exactly what you are going through.

'It is being brave enough, like you obviously were, to reach out to those around you.'

The palace also announced that Kate will visit the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London on 14 November after having to postpone her engagement there in September following her battle with severe morning sickness.

During her visit, she will learn more about Family Action's perinatal mental health services and meet parents who have been helped by the charity, reports HELLO! Magazine.

Despite being pregnant, the Duchess shows no signs of reducing her royal duties, as she's scheduled to attend a gala dinner for the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families at Kensington Palace next week. The following day, she will also carry out an engagement with children's mental health charity Place2Be.

What a busy bee Kate is at the moment!

James Corden gets punched in the face during Subway 'Carpool Karaoke' with Sting and Shaggy at Grammy Awards 2018,https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a848608/james-corden-subway-karaoke-with-sting-and-shaggy-grammy-awards-2018/,www.digitalspy.com,13,1,"We're not sure if you heard but James Corden's Carpool Karaoke on The Late Late Show segments are pretty popular... but it turns out not everyone's a fan.

What to Read Next

It's true that the comedian racks up the LOLs whenever he's belting out hits with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Mariah Carey, Harry Styles and so many more in the comfort of his own car. The key is these sketches take place in his car.

On Sunday's (January 28), Corden decided to surprise commuters on their way to work in New York for the first-ever Subway Karaoke in celebration of the Grammy Awards coming back to NYC.

CBS

He even roped in Sting and Shaggy — who, for some reason, have made an album together — to sing the Police classic 'Every Breath You Take' and the 2000s banger 'It Wasn't Me' on the subway too.

Turns out New Yorkers don't want to hear Sting, Shaggy, Corden or anyone else singing to them on their subway ride, as you can see in the hilarious clip below:

Reactions ranged from angry passengers shouting at them, rolling their eyes or throwing money at them in order to get the trio to shut the hell up.

""We're not begging,"" a disheartened Corden complained. ""We're trying to create a viral moment.""

Better luck next time, Jimmy! The 60th annual Grammy Awards aired live on CBS on Sunday (January 28) from the historic Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Laura Prepon and Ben Foster Are Married! 'Thank You for All the Love',https://people.com/movies/laura-prepon-ben-foster-are-married/,people.com,159,1,"Laura Prepon and Ben Foster have finally tied the knot!

Prepon, 38, announced the exciting news on Instagram Sunday, posting a wedding photo of the husband and wife smiling and embracing.

“Just Married! Thank you for all the love and support,” the actress wrote in the caption. “Wishing all of us the good stuff!

The couple welcomed their first child, daughter Ella, in August. PEOPLE confirmed Prepon’s baby news in January, just a few months after Foster popped the question back in fall 2016.

Planning the wedding around their busy schedules wasn’t easy. “He’s going off to do two movies,” Prepon told E! News at the Sundance Film Festival in January. “I just wrapped last week. It’s just, you know, scheduling. It’s a lot.”

She added, “We want a really small wedding but we have a lot of people that we love and care about. It’s weird, [but] apparently doing the list for your wedding is a whole thing that could cause some issues. Our cast alone is like, 50 people!”

The Orange Is the New Black actress opened up about her pregnancy during an appearance on Live with Kelly and Ryan in June, admitting that it had gone by quickly.

“It’s kind of weird because it sneaks up on you, you’re like, ‘I can’t believe it’s been eight months already,’ ” she said at the time. “But then you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, she needs to come out already.’ ”

Prepon also expressed her excitement to start a family with Foster, 37, telling the morning show hosts, “it’s so wonderful, it’s such a blessing.”"

Production on Season 3 of This Is Us began Tuesday in Los Angeles, and show creator Dan Fogelman is already tweeting sneak peeks of the feel-good family action. The first photo is of one of the camera monitors revealing Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) in a moment of celebration. See? Watson wasn't lying that Beth is alright. Everyone can take a sigh of relief.

We don't know yet exactly when Season 3 of This Is Us will pick up with the Pearsons, but it looks like the first scene might be a little while after (or before) Kate's (Chrissy Metz) wedding if Beth and Randall are jubilant instead of freaking out about their ruined car.

On Wednesday, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 37, unveiled the bottle for her newest scent ‘KKW Body’ on social media.

“Alright guys, I want to show you my bottle for ‘KKW Body,'” Kardashian West said in her Instagram story, as she opened up a grey colored box, which featured a nude figure, inspired by her own body, inside.

“So this is not the press box you guys, this is the regular box,” she continued. “I didn’t do press boxes because I wanted everyone to get this amazing box, I thought this was such a cool box within itself, that the bottle is like on a statue pedestal like a statue in a museum.”

For the past three days, the reality star has been posting a series of suggestive nude images to promote her fragrance, despite the drama surrounding her husband, Kanye West, who spent Wednesday on Twitter spree after some in his inner circle expressed concern about him.

On Monday, Kardashian West shared a photo, in which she’s posing topless with her arm across her chest, to announce the launch of the fragrance. “KKW BODY 4.30 by Vanessa Beecroft,” she captioned the snap, noting that controversial artist, Beecroft, is involved in the project.

In a separate post on Tuesday, Kardashian West shared a full-frontal nude picture of herself. In the behind-the-scenes photograph, the mom of three was covered in grey plaster, but that was not enough to cover her nether region or her nipples, so she was forced to blur out her private parts.

“We took a mold of my body and made it a perfume bottle,” she captioned the revealing image.

On top of her upcoming KKW Fragrance launch, Kardashian West also teamed up with Lumee to design her own collection of Kimoji-covered cases, available now online.

Before unveiling her new fragrance bottle, Kardashian West defended her husband, who has been making headlines for his ongoing Twitter spree, in a series of tweets of her own.

“To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this… your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair,” she wrote.

Continued Kardashian West: “Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye’s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I’m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening.”

“He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America?” she added. “Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive.”

Kardashian West also addressed her husband’s series of tweets about Donald Trump in which he called the president his “brother” and said the two “are both dragon energy.” (“You don’t have to agree with Trump but the mob can’t make me not love him,” he said, though he clarified: “I’m not even political. I’m not a Democrat or a Republican.”)

“When he spoke out about Trump… Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this,” the mom of three said. “But this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine.”

“He never said he agrees with his politics,” she added.

Last but not least, Kardashian West praised her husband for being unique, even if he’s not universally liked.

“Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them!” she wrote. “Kanye is years ahead of his time.”"

Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a13561434/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-timeline/,www.cosmopolitan.com,1,1,"Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn dated for six years, but thanks to his super guarded approach to talking about his personal life, their relationship mostly stayed shrouded in mystery.



The longer they were together, the more fans learned about their romance - from Joe's appearance in Taylor's Netflix documentary, to his writing credits on her albums, which were written during London's coronavirus lockdown.

Here's a timeline with as much information as we could find about Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's relationship, dating back to 2016 and concluding in 2023.

June 2024: Joe Alwyn responds to a question over whether he has listened to ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift's latest album The Tortured Poets Department, and while he didn't give a direct answer, he did share an insight into how he's been getting on since the break up.

Speaking to The Sunday Times , the actor said, ""In thinking on what I was going to say [about TTPS], I would think and hope that anyone and everyone can empathise... This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but just thinking about what I want to talk about. I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathise and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years.”

Speaking about their split, Joe added, “That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.

“So you have something very real suddenly thrown into a very unreal space: tabloids, social media, press, where it is then dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition. And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.”

Here's the rest of Taylor and Joe's relationship timeline:

3 May 2016: So where Joe and Tay met isn't 100% clear, which makes the start date to this timeline a tad tricky but, bear with us.

It's May, 2016 and both attend the Met Gala. I know what you're thinking, this link may seem tenuous given that the whole of Hollywood goes BUT Swift's new song 'Dress' - where she sings: 'Flashback to when you met me/ Your buzz cut/ And my hair bleached' -has provided some fans with the theory that the 2016 event could be significant.

Getty Images

A-ha! At the gala, Joe's hair is certainly shorter and Taylor rocks a bleached blonde bob...



However, this Met Gala is also seemingly full of Taylor-related events as a video of her and (soon to be boyfriend) Tom Hiddleston having a dance-off to Beyonce's Crazy in Love does the rounds on the internet.

Just a month later, she announces she has broken up with boyfriend of a year Calvin Harris and weeks later she's pictured kissing Tom Hiddleston. 'Hiddleswift', as they become to be known, break up in September, 2016.

12 October 2016: Taylor and a whole load of squad members (Is the squad still a thing?) including Lorde, Cara Delevingne, Dakota Johnson and Martha Hunt attend a secret Kings of Leon concert in New York City. It's widely reported that Joe was also there and this is the place where the couple meet.

Getty Images Taylor and Dakota Johnson in NYC on October 12, 2016

12 November 2016: Taylor is papped going to watch a film with her mother and two of the Haim sisters Este and Alana in Los Angeles. And what film is this? Only Joe Alwyn's film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.

Coincidence orrrrr?

16 May 2017: Unfortunately, we can't fill you in on what specifically happened over the six months between November 2016 and May 2017 because the couple were so darn good at hiding their relationship.

In May, the story of their relationship finally breaks. The Sun reports that the pair have been dating in secret for months (seems about right) and that Taylor is ""besotted"" with him.

They add that she's been spending lots of time in London with him, using wigs, scarves and hats as a disguise.

""Taylor and Joe are the real deal, this is a very serious relationship,"" a source tells the newspaper. ""...Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.""

1 June 2017: As well as Taylor's Mission Impossible-style visits to the UK, Joe also flies to see Taylor in New York, reports E! News.

""Taylor and Joe have really tried to be on lockdown and have spent most of their time together in private locations where they could get to know each other without the pressure of a public relationship and people making judgement calls,"" a source tells the outlet.

2 June 2017: E! News covers the story a day later, reporting that Joe has finally met... the squad.

Apparently, Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid, as well as other ""close friends"", had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know their pals' new beau.

5 June 2017: Taylor and Joe are pictured together for the first time in a paparazzi shot. The two are seen enjoying coffee on a balcony in Nashville, Tennessee and Taylor is smiling. Cute! It's reported that Joe is there to meet the parents. Dun dun dunnnn.

As well as this, reports that Taylor is house-hunting in London - the city where none other than bloomin' Joe lives - also do the rounds.

26 July 2017: Taylor and Joe are photographed again, however, this time they're really trying not to be. Pictures in the Mail Online show the couple wearing hoodies and keeping their eyes to the ground as they leave the singer's New York City apartment.

5 September 2017: Taylor is back with new music and everyone is freaking out trying to guess who and what all the songs are about. After all, she's had a fairly eventful couple of years since her last album.

One song '...Ready for It?' has fans divided over whether it's about Joe or her former love interest Harry Styles. But then... according to Buzzfeed, Taylor reportedly likes a Tumblr post breaking down the lyrics, with all signs pointing to them being about Joe.

21 September 2017: The secret transatlantic visits show no slowing down and they've reportedly been made easier by Taylor's famous mates.

According to The Sun, Cara Delevingne hosted the couple at her house in west London so that they could continue to keep the whole thing on the DL while visiting Joe's family and friends.

""She's trying to keep a low profile with Joe and staying with Cara has let her do that,"" a source told the tabloid. ""... They can even walk Cara's dog round the local park without anyone batting an eyelid.""

20 October 2017:

Another song from Taylor's forthcoming album Reputation drops and it's called 'Gorgeous'. According to fans, Taylor told them the song was about Joe during one of her secret listening sessions.

Lyrics include: ""You should take it as a compliment / That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk / You should think about he consequence / Of your magnetic field being a little too strong /And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us.""

Firstly, Joe is British and Taylor is American which could explain the whole making fun of the way you talk thing. Secondly, her two previous boyfriends have been in their 30s and therefore older than Joe.

26 October 2017:

Taylor's BFF Ed Sheeran pipes up, telling a radio station he thinks Joe is a ""good dude"".

Giving the seal of approval, the 'Shape of You' singer tells Capital London's Breakfast Show: ""He's really nice. Really, really friendly, really good dude"".

3 November 2017: The fourth song from Reputation drops and this time it's 'Call It What You Want' which fans think seems to include a mix of references about both the Kimye feud and Joe.

Here are the lyrics which might be about Joe:

""My baby's fly like a jet stream/ High above the whole scene"" - potentially referencing that Joe is not as famous as some of Swift's previous love interests.

10 November 2017: Taylor's 15-track album is released in full, proving plenty more lyrics for us to try and dissect. Among the many fan theories pointing to lines about Joe, a couple are:

'Don't Blame Me': ""I've been breaking hearts a long time, and toying with them older guys just to play things for me to use / Don't blame me, your love made me crazy / My drug is my baby / I'll be using for the rest of my life""

The fact that Taylor seems to talk about the future in the last line indicates she's singing about a current relationship, i.e. her and Joe.

'Delicate': ""My reputation's never been worse, so you must like me for me / Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you / Oh damn, never seen that colour blue.""

It's fair to say Taylor's public reputation took a bash during the time she met Joe, which she could be hinting at when she describes how the mysterious subject of the song was into her regardless.

He also has very blue eyes, we might add.



6 April 2018: Taylor is reportedly keen to buy a £30m house in north London's Crouch End, so she can ""set down roots"" near where Joe and his family live.

A source told The Sun: “Taylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,"" the source said. “Setting down roots is something she’s thought long and hard about. She’s set aside £30million ($42million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.""

29 September 2018: Taylor and Joe are spotted hand-in-hand heading towards the singer's New York City apartment together.

22 November 2018: Would you believe it? Taylor is actually tagging Joe in a post on Instagram! It's all to promote his new movie The Favourite, which he stars in with Olivia Coleman, Emma Stone and Nicholas Hoult. Taylor calls the film ""phenomenal"" and tells her followers to go see it.

11 December 2018: aTaylor Swift managed to slip into the London premiere of Joe's move Mary Queen Of Scots, and no one noticed. Well, until Izuka Hoyle, who plays courtier Mary Seton, shared an Instagram Story of the pair chatting in the cinema's lobby, along with the caption, ""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone"".

Instagram Stories

While fans are desperate for their first official red carpet moment for Joe and Taylor, a source told The Sun the singer didn't want to distract from her boyfriend's achievements.

""Taylor didn't want to draw attention to herself because it was really Joe's night"", the insider commented. ""But she did want to support him and knew he would appreciate her being there, so she took steps to try and prevent anyone knowing she was there.

""It worked in the dark of the cinema but by the time they made it to the party afterwards her cover was blown.""

6 January 2019: A new year and yet Taylor and Joe still appear to be going strong. The two attended the Golden Globes, separately, of course and then hit up several after-parties following the show.

Taylor was spotted at the InStyle/Warner Bros party - where she posed on the red carpet - and then at Fox's and Netflix's soirees, as was Joe. At the Netflix afterparty, ""Taylor Swift, was the star of the party, sitting in a VIP area next to [Netflix CCO Ted] Sarandos. At one point, Sarandos approached Swift and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn to ask for a photo with the star. Swift obliged, but was quickly met with more and more photo requests from other attendees at the party. Security called for backup to her section to give her some privacy, but Swift and Alwyn left the event shortly after,"" per The Hollywood Reporter.

A reporter for Entertainment Tonight also told his Twitter followers how he'd witnessed ""Joe Alwyn give Taylor Swift a kiss at the Fox afterparty"". Cute!

17 January 2019: Given that Joe is in every film under the sun at the start of 2019 (well, it feels like it, he has parts in The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots) he conducts some interviews to promote these movies.



In one with , he objects to being labelled ""strangely private"" over his and Taylor's refusal to discuss their relationship. He tells the magazine he doesn't think he's had to ""fight for his privacy"" more than anyone else in the public eye and it seems like he's just of the opinion he doesn't have to share one of the more personal sides of his life with the rest of the world.

""I don't think anyone you meet on the streets would just spill their guts out to you, therefore why should I?"" he says. ""And then that is defined as being 'strangely private'. Fine. But I don't think it is. I think it's normal.""

10 February 2019: Taylor skipped the Grammys so she could support Joe at the BAFTAs, where his film, The Favourite, won like a million awards. Look how sweet they look together!

Plus, Taylor posted this sweet message on Instagram...

24 February 2019: Taylor and Joe reportedly attended not one, not two, but THREE pre-Oscars parties together.

They were spotted at the Night Before party and the CAA bash as well as another event, with Perez Hilton claiming it was ""PDA all over the place"".

""Taylor Swift hit up three parties with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn,"" Perez told Australian radio show KIIS FM's Kyle & Jackie O.

He added: ""They went to such great lengths in 2018 to every avoid being seen in public together. Now finally not only are they going to events and supporting each other. But PDA all over the place.

24 February 2019: While Joe Alwyn attended the Oscars alone, he was later joined by Taylor Swift at the Vanity Fair party. Other party goers went to great lengths to document the singer's presence, with one catching a lowkey moment of PDA between the pair on video. Adorable.

21 March 2019: Despite it making it very very hard for fans to get updates on how their relationship is going, being secretive is apparently the key to making things work between Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn.

According to a source atPeople, ""Keeping it private from the beginning really helped their relationship. They were able to get to know each other in peace.""

While there are rumours going around that Joe is planning a proposal, Taylor is apparently just happy to be with him whatever happens. ""Taylor really got lucky to meet Joe, and she is the first one to say it,” a source said. “Joe really is one of a kind.”

The insider added that ""They have a very special relationship. Joe adores Taylor"", before commenting on the fact they're ""very compatible,"" ""respectful"" of each other’s careers, and ""so sweet"" together.

ALRIGHT GUYS. We get it. Anyone else feeling very very single right now?



17 July 2019: Joe has been supporting Taylor during all this nasty Scooter Braun business.

A source told Hollywood Life, ""Taylor‘s loved ones have all rallied around her to support her through this battle, she is not alone in this fight. Her boyfriend Joe has been a total rock in all of this, he is very supportive of her taking a stand… he has got a strong backbone.""

The source added: ""Taylor has always been pretty fearless when it comes to speaking her truth but having such a solid and healthy relationship makes her feel that much stronger. What she is going through with Scooter is so challenging, but the good news is that her personal life is all smooth sailing. She is very grateful for that.""

12 August 2019: Taylor fans think the singer is secretly engaged to Joe, after she shared some particularly telling lyrics from her new album with Vogue.

In the track, which they describe as both 'haunting' and 'romantic', Taylor sings, ""My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue. All’s well that ends well to end up with you.""

Something borrowed? Something blue? End up with you? Certainly sounds like a hint towards marriage, doesn't it? Well, Taylor's fans definitely think so, with many taking to Twitter to speculate about whether the singer just announced her engagement.

""HOLD UP SOMETHING BORROWED SOMETHING BLUE? MS.SWIFT ARE YOU GONNA BE TAYLOR ALWYN?"" one fan wrote, while another added, ""I think Taylor Swift just told us she's engaged. That's it. That's the tweet.""

A third added, ""If Taylor Swift is secretly engaged to Joe Alwyn I’ll never be calm again.""

23 August 2019: Taylor releases her new album, Lover, and fans are convinced that these songs - and these lyrics in particular are about Joe.

Why fans think this is about Joe: He was born and raised in London. Simple as that.

5th January 2020: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn had a very public date night at the Golden Globes awards, where Taylor was nominated for Best Original Song for 'Beautiful Ghosts' from Cats. She lost out to Elton John and Bernie Taupin for '(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again' from Rocketman, but did get to go to a fancy dinner with her boyfriend. So who's complaining?

23 January 2020: Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift are famously very private about their romance, but fans get to see a different side to their relationship in her Netflix documentary, Miss Americana. In it, not only does Taylor hug Joe backstage at one of her shows, but we also see her tenderly kiss his hand in the back of a taxi.

13 February 2020: Taylor and Joe show some major PDA at the NME Awards, where she wins the award for Best Solo Act In The World. Fans capture videos of her and her boyfriend kissing, hugging, and generally just being really cute together:

29 April 2020: Joe Alwyn shares a little insight into self isolation with Taylor Swift, posting three Instagram Stories of one of her beloved cats.

The 29-year-old actor posted three photos of the blue-eyed cat named Benjamin Button: in one he lay in a paper shopping bag, before hiding in a cardboard box and under a rug. Taylor also has two other cats; Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey named after TV characters.

Instagram Stories/Joe Alwyn

November 2020: Following fan speculation in the summer, Taylor Swift confirms Joe Alwyn did indeed work with her on Folklore - her surprise 8th studio album which dropped in July. At the time, fan speculated about who William Bowery was, an anonymous person credited as co-writer on two songs.

They came up with theories about why the name was linked to Joe, and the singer has since revealed her boyfriend did indeed write the piano parts for 'Betty' and 'Exile'. Speaking about the surprise collaboration in her new documentary, folklore: the long pond studio sessions on Disney+, Taylor said:

""There's been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity. He's not a real person... William Bowery is Joe, as we know. And Joe, Joe plays piano beautifully, and he's always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things.""

She later revealed, ""I just heard Joe singing the entire, fully formed chorus of 'Betty' from another room. And I just was like, 'Hello,'"" Taylor said. ""It was a step that we would never have taken because why would we have ever written a song together? This was the first time we had a conversation where I came in and I was like, 'Hey, this could be really weird and we could hate this, so could we just, because we're in quarantine and there's nothing else going on, could we just try to see what it's like if we write this song together?'""

As for his involvement with the song 'Exile'? ""Joe had written that entire piano part and he was singing the Bon Iver part... He was just singing it. And so, I was entranced and I asked if we could keep writing that one. It was pretty obvious that it should be a duet, 'cause he's got such a low voice and it sounded really good sung down there in that register.""

We are SO ready for a Joe/Taylor duet album.

November 2020: Taylor speaks about Joe during an interview with Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone.

Discussing Folklore song 'Peace', Taylor explained, ""'Peace' is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you [McCartney] have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living.

""I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalise things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.""

Asked by McCartney, ""Does your partner sympathise with that and understand?"" Taylor responded, ""Oh, absolutely. ... But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids.

""Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song 'Peace' is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?""

January 2021: After 11 months of not being seen out together (and being locked down because of you know what), Swift and Alwyn are photographed in London, out on a walk with his mum. Cute.

February 2021: Taylor reveals Joe encouraged her to use her platform to speak out about her political views during part of her Miss Americana Netflix documentary. ""As a country musician, I was always told it's better to stay out of [politics],"" she told Vanity Fair. ""The Trump presidency forced me to lean in and educate myself. I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend [Joe Alwyn], who supported me in speaking out.""

March 2021: Taylor thanks Joe during her GRAMMYs 2021 acceptance speech, and the whole moment is *so* cute. Picking up the gong for Album Of The Year for Folklore at the 63rd GRAMMY Awards, Taylor thanked Joe for both his personal support and his contributions to the album as a songwriter (with Joe working under the pseudonym William Bowery).

Taylor told viewers, ""I will thank all of my collaborators who are on this stage,"" before going on to thank Joe who wasn't on stage at the time.

She went on, ""Joe, who is the first person that I play every single song that I write and I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine.""

FYI, Taylor also made history with her GRAMMYs 2021 win becoming the first female artist ever to win Album of the Year three times. 100% something to celebrate.

May 2021: Taylor takes home the Global Icon award at the 2021 Brits, and thanks Joe once again in her acceptance speech. “I want to thank my friends and family who know exactly who they are: whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down,"" she said.

""If there’s one thing that I’ve learned, it’s that you have to look around every day and take note of the people who have always believed in you and never stop appreciating them for it. Never take them for granted.""

13th September 2021: Taylor took a trip to Belfast to support Joe as he wrapped filming for the BBC's adaptation of Sally Rooney novel Conversations with Friends.

Belfast cocktail bar The Tipsy Bird shared the news by posting an adorable picture of Taylor alongside staff on Instagram. They wrote, ""The one and only @taylorswift graced us with her presence last Friday night💫.""

Confirming that Taylor was indeed in town to visit Joe, they added, ""Taylor was here to support her boyfriend Joe who has just wrapped up filming the TV series Conversations with Friends.""

Plus, the news that Swifties want to hear: ""We can confirm she is just as lovely as you would expect and was kind enough to take a picture with our team.""



Cute!

What's more, Belfast restaurant Shu also reported seeing Taylor drop in, sharing a series of selfies of the singer with staff. They wrote on Instagram, ""On Thursday evening we had the pleasure of serving Taylor swift! 🤭 Taylor was so lovely and really is a beautiful person inside and out and she kindly agreed to get photos with all our staff!""

23rd November 2021: Taylor supports Joe on set once again by spending time on the film set for his project, The Stars at Noon. A source told E! News, ""Taylor visited her boyfriend on the set of his movie.""

The Stars at Noon is an adaptation of Denis Johnson's novel of the same name, with Maid's Margaret Qualley also starring alongside Joe. Set in Nicaragua, the film reportedly was shot in Panama - with Taylor paying a visit to Joe on set.



17th January 2022: Taylor and Joe headed across the Atlantic to welcome in 2022, reportedly staying in St Ives, Cornwall for a romantic break. They apparently spent three days together in the coastal town, with a source reporting that St Ives is ""particularly special"" to the couple.



The insider told The Sun, ""Taylor’s a superstar and obviously very wealthy, so she can travel almost anywhere she wants at any time. But to go that far just for a few days clearly meant a lot to them.""

The source went on to bring up engagement rumours surrounding Taylor and Joe, saying, ""It feels like things are getting more serious and people think an engagement could be on the cards. That could explain such a long journey to a specific place.""

They went on, ""Taylor is keeping her cards close to her chest, but they’re certainly very happy and enjoying their time together.""

Sharing an insight into how the pair got on during the pandemic, the insider added, ""Lockdown made things even more serious and they’ve lived together throughout.""

As for what Taylor and Joe got up to on their hols, the publication reports that the couple rented a house rather than staying in a hotel, according to sources, before flying back to Maine in the US. Meanwhile, a friend of the pair reportedly added, ""It sounds a gorgeous trip.""

8th February 2022: Joe recently shared a little snippet into his relationship with Taylor, during an interview about his upcoming Hulu series - an adaptation of Sally Rooney's Conversations With Friends.

In the show, Joe's character is in an open relationship, and in a recent interview, (via E!) he was asked if it's something he would consider in his own personal life. ""I think people can do what they want and makes them happy,"" he said. ""I'm obviously happy in a monogamous relationship."" Aw!

21 April 2022: Joe Alwyn opens up about the constant Taylor Swift engagement rumours, explaining he wouldn't confirm if they were true either way. Fair enough.

""If I had a pound for every time I think I've been told I've been engaged, then I'd have a lot of pound coins,"" he joked to the Wall Street Journal. ""I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn't say.""

On the topic of fan attention and interest in their relationship, he added, ""We live in a culture that people expect so much to be given. So that if you're not posting all the time about what you're doing, how you're spending a day or how you made a breakfast, does that make you a recluse?

""I'd also like to feel slightly less guarded sometimes in interviews or in whatever kind of interactions, but it's just a knee-jerk response to the culture we live in. If you give it to them, it just opens the door.""

11 May 2022: Joe spoke out about how Taylor feels about all his sex scenes in new Sally Rooney series Conversations with Friends, because watching your partner of six years sleeping with a bunch of people on TV can't be easy.

Well, it turns out Taylor was basically ready for it, not only has she read the book but she's a huge fan of the whole thing of Joe's work on the series in general.

ELEMENT PICTURES/ENDA BOWE

""I mean she's read the book and she loves the book so she knows it,"" Joe told Extra after being asked about Taylor's response to his sex scenes with costar Alison Oliver. ""She just like couldn't be a bigger fan of the project.""

Supportive and cute!

The breakup comes during Taylor's The Eras tour, and the source addressed Joe's absence at these live dates, explaining it was due to the split. ""The relationship had just run its course,"" they said. ""It's why [Joe] hasn't been spotted at any shows.""

The news was also later confirmed to People.

Our thoughts are with these two and we hope they're doing okay - scroll below to look back at the full timeline of their six-year relationship.

30th November 2023 - Taylor Swift's rep responds to claims Taylor and Joe Alwyn were secretly married, following a number of anonymous tip offs to gossip site, @DeuxMoi.

Taylor's publicist Tree Paine responded: "" Enough is enough with these fabricated lies about Taylor from Deuxmoi. There was NEVER a marriage or ceremony of ANY kind. This is an insane thing to post. It’s time for you to be held accountable for the pain and trauma you cause with posts like these."""
Ex-Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Criticizes Show Producers Over Finale Edit,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-criticizes-editing-her-finale-1132842,www.hollywoodreporter.com,56,1,"The finale of The Bachelorette has sparked another lead from the ABC reality dating franchise to speak out candidly about how her own finale was edited by show producers.

Rachel Lindsay, the historic star of The Bachelorette‘s 2017 cycle, got engaged to winner Bryan Abasolo on her season 13 finale. Now, however, she is opening up to say, “I was denied my on-camera happy ending” and “labeled an angry black female.”

Lindsay was the first black lead of the long-running franchise, which just wrapped its 14th season of The Bachelorette on Monday night. Lindsay remains the only black star in the franchise’s combined 26 seasons, and though her long overdue casting was praised and her season was initially celebrated for its diversity, the cycle ended up being criticized for race-baiting for drama.

In a blog post about Becca Kufrin’s finale for Us Weekly, Lindsay details how her TV ending played out differently than the one that just aired. Kufrin accepted a proposal from her winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, who has emerged as a controversial pick given his past social media history of liking several memes espousing offensive rhetoric.

Lindsay, who remains happily engaged to Abasolo, says the pretaped portion of the latest finale gave Kufrin and Yrigoyen the “true definition” of a happy ending. After the proposal, the live aftershow saw the couple return to discuss their journey off-camera, including the Instagram scandal. But Lindsay says what she endured on the night of her finale was much worse.

“Becca did not sit on stage for three hours and watch the finale for the first time in front of a live audience,” Lindsay wrote, recalling how her part of the live post-finale special, After the Final Rose, cut into the pretaped portion. “Becca did not have to deal with someone telling her she would live a mediocre life. Becca did not have to deal with being baited with real-time questions about her emotions watching certain scenes. Nope, that was me.”

As viewers will recall, much of Lindsay’s finale centered around the departure of her runner-up, Peter Kraus, and she criticized the show for focusing more on the breakup than the proposal.

“Let’s just be honest, Becca did not have the finale that I had,” she continued. “There was no controversy and she was not put in a position to face any. She was protected and I was placed on display for three hours and labeled an angry black female. And there will always be that stigma attached to my finale because it has been said that when truth is blurred by misinformation, perception becomes reality and all is lost.”

Lindsay summed up what was meant to be a finale recap by challenging ABC and show producers to do better.

“The Bachelor franchise does believe in happy endings — some people get an on-camera happy ending, some people get on off-camera happy ending, and some people get both,” she says. “For Becca, I truly hope she gets both. As for my happy ending, it was not demonstrated within the confines of your television screens, but I am living it every day in real life. So in regards to a future on-camera happy ending and whether or not I will get married on TV, I have no idea but they damn sure owe us one.”

At the time, Lindsay said that a lot of her relationship with Abasolo was left on the cutting-room floor because their relationship was drama-free. Instead, much of the focus was on Lindsay sending Kraus home early over his hesitance about proposing. “Bryan was the person,” she said of why she sent Kraus home. “I’m only in love with one person through that entire season. I wanted that proposal to be all about Bryan. I wanted him to be the focus.”

This year’s Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr., also spoke out after his season wrapped to say that he felt “betrayed” by how show producers edited his controversial finale, which resulted in Kufrin being named as the Bachelorette."
Dancing with the Stars’ Debbie Gibson Gets Emotional In First Performance Since Lyme Disease Diagnosis,https://www.fame10.com/trending-news/dancing-with-the-stars-debbie-gibson-gets-emotional-in-first-performance-since-lyme-disease-diagnosis/,www.fame10.com,65,1,"Source: Alan Bersten Instagram

Despite it only being week one, contestant Debbie Gibson has already overcome huge obstacles during her time on Dancing with the Stars!

The brand new season premiered Monday on ABC and viewers were astonished by Gibson’s first performance since being diagnosed with Lyme disease. “This is like a coming-out party. I’ve continued to perform here and there but I’ve been really scared to do something of this magnitude because I have unpredictable symptoms,” Debbie shared. “My nervous system was acting out yesterday. I didn’t sleep last night. It really tests your strength.”

“Today, it just feels like I haven’t slept in four days. But again, you know what, I’ve learned through this journey that everyone is going through something,” she explained after her first dance in the ballroom. “You can look at people and you just don’t know what they’re going through. So, you know, I’ve done more this month, in the past month, preparing for this show than I have in an entire year.”

The “Only in My Dreams” singer was diagnosed with Lyme disease back in 2013 after experiencing symptoms of extreme pain, weight loss, weakness and joint pain. She told PEOPLE that when she was offered the chance to participate on the show she was “going through the fire again,” but pushed through in hopes of inspiring those who are also struggling with their health.

“For anyone at home going through anything, I want to be here to say you don’t have to get stuck, you don’t have to curl up in a ball on your couch,” she shared. “You can live, you can get busy living.”"
The Phone Case That Bathes My Selfies in Flattering Light,http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/lumee-lighting-phone-case-kim-kardashian-selfie.html,nymag.com,58,1,"One day, I found myself Googling “Kim Kardashian selfie tips” (I realize I’m part of the problem here, but the girl knows how to find her light), and discovered her favorite selfie accessory: the LuMee Duo, a smartphone case kitted out with an onboard lighting system to mimic the glow of a flattering-on-everyone ring light.

The design is simple: dual rows of LEDs run along each side of the case (front and back), and bathe your face in transformative light whenever you need it. I decided to buy it on a lark, convinced I was throwing $68 directly out the window, but at least I’d have a fun story. Instead, it’s become my constant companion.

First of all: the light. You’ll find that it’s beyond embarrassing to use the LuMee Duo in public (you’re flashing a blazing rectangle of light onto yourself and everyone in the vicinity, after all), but it produces undeniably perfect photos. Turn it on and you’re awash in a warm (or incandescent, depending on your preference) radiance that’s almost angelic. You know how makeup contouring is all about creating the perfect shadows and light on your face? The LuMee’s glow is the effect it’s going for.

The advancement of the new Duo (which came out late last year) is, of course, the rows of LEDs now on the back of the case. Not just for selfies anymore, the case gives your phone powerful lighting on both sides — it’s like your flashlight app on steroids. Now, my main photography subject is actually not myself, but my black chihuahua, Casey. He’s impossible to photograph in anything other than full sunlight, but the Duo has turned my pet photos into Instagram gold. Not only that — if I drop something on the floor of a movie theater, the powerful light means I’ll spot it right away. Add to that the powerful battery: a full USB charge lasts over two hours of continuous use; I only juice mine up once every two weeks or so, and I’ve spent $68 on stupider things."

Britney Spears and Sam Asghari Get a Head Start on Birthday Celebrations with a Sweet Smooch,https://people.com/music/britney-spears-sam-asghari-birthday-kiss/,people.com,89,1,"Britney Spears and Sam Asghari are still smitten.

The couple shared a sweet PDA-packed photo on Instagram Thursday as Asghari, 24, shared his excitement for his girlfriend’s upcoming 37th birthday on Dec. 2. “Guess whose birthday is coming up? #princess,” the shirtless personal trainer-turned-model captioned the image.

Spears, who is mom to sons Sean Preston, 13, and Jayden James, 12, simply shared three pink bow emojis along with her post.

The pop icon and her boyfriend continue to publicly show off their affection for one another since their romance blossomed after they met on the set of her “Slumber Party” video shoot.

The cute pair has been inseparable since, going on cozy date night dinners, attending friends’ birthday parties and celebrating special occasions together — including Spears’ recent birthday and Valentine’s Day. The couple even fueled engagement rumors after Spears was spotted vacationing on a Hawaiian beach with a sparkly diamond ring on that finger.

Despite their strong relationship, it was nearly a missed connection.

After their initial meeting, Spears dug up his phone number out of her bag nearly “five months later,” she revealed in a January 2017 radio interview.

“I was like, ‘He was really cute, this guy was really cute,’ so I called him,” she said. “He’s just a really fun, funny person.”

Soon, Spears will return to Las Vegas to kick off her latest residency Domination in February 2019 at the Park Theater at Park MGM, which is the same venue where Lady Gaga, Cher, Bruno Mars and Aerosmith will be performing their respective shows."

The Kardashians donate whopping sum to Las Vegas mass shooting victims,https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/the-kardashians-donate-whopping-sum-to-las-vegas-mass-shooting-victims/,web.archive.org,1,0,"The Kardashian family has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, and they’re using their wealth to step up in a big way for those in need. The reality TV family banded together to raise $1 million to the families of victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

Earlier today, we announced that the Kardashian family will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.

Also, to benefit those impacted by the shooting, the Kardashian family will be hosting a “Day of Giving” on October 7. A “Day of Giving” will begin on Friday morning with other American celebrities and continue throughout the day on E!News. Across our social platforms, there will be a #DayofGiving call-to-action to donate to the victims of Las vegas shooting, with those dollars going to benefit those most impacted, the statement read.

“Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting,” said Kim Kardashian. The most decorated family said it’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.”-the family continued.

“Las Vegas we are praying for you,” Khloé Kardashian tweeted immediately after announcing the family’s donation.

More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 more injured in a terrifying massacre Sunday night. It’s being reported by outlets as the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.

A gunman, now identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire on a country-music festival from a hotel window inside the nearby Mandalay Bay. Paddock shot and killed himself; Las Vegas Metro Police officers found him dead in the room.

Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Las Vegas and again it’s our most fervent prayer we get enough security to make life fright-free again in the Nevada city."

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE

What is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak."

“I think you’ve got a president who has some very serious emotional problems.”

“I’m especially concerned about his constant tweets about North Korea. It’s already bad and he is adding fuel to the fire.”

Romney added, “You’ve got a president who has been accused, by many, many women of harassment, to say the least. This is a guy who was on a tape seen by everybody in America essentially bragging about his sexual assault of women.”

“Do I think under those considerations of Al Franken resigned, do I think the president should resign? I do. Do I think he will? I don’t. But, yes, I do think he should resign.”

Romney continued, “Let me take it a little step further.

British film producer and the co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan released statements on Ronan’s death on Monday.

Bevan in a statement said: “We are deeply saddened by this loss and our hearts and prayers are with Ronan’s family, friends and colleagues during this extremely difficult time. She was 23.”

“Our production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Saoirse Ronan who was a key character in our upcoming movie ‘Mary Queen of Scots’,” Bevan said. “Ronan’s work on ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations. We are grateful for her contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to Ronan’s family and friends.”

According to Beausejour Coroner Bradley Cyril, Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall. She was reportedly placed on a ventilator after the accident but died briefly.

The Golden Globe Award winner fell more than 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a serious head injury that required her to be transported to a nearby hospital by an ambulance. Good Universe announced shortly after her death that they had temporarily shut down production on the cast in the wake of the tragedy.

Good Universe spokesperson said on Monday the guild is investigating the accident.

“We are saddened to report that Charlize Theron, our irreplaceable star for ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and numerous other television shows and films, suffered serious injuries from a tragic accident on set,” the Production said in a statement on Monday. “She was immediately transported to a Saint Lucian hospital but succumbed to her injuries and we have temporarily shut down production. The safety of our members is paramount. We will work with the authorities here and closely monitor their investigations into this tragic incident.”

In addition, the Saint Lucian office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed to Variety this morning that they have launched their own investigation into the incident.

Saoirse Úna Ronan came to international prominence in 2007 after co-starring as Briony Tallis in the film Atonement with James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, for which she received nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award, making her one of the youngest actresses to receive an Oscar nomination.

Her film breakthrough was followed by her starring role in Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones for which she was awarded a Critics’ Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and a second BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress. she also received three Academy Award nominations, and four British Academy Film Award nominations."
112-Year-Old Voters in North Carolina?,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2012/11/06/112-year-old-voters-in-north-carolina,www.pewtrusts.org,64,0,"Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.

Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.

The true explanation is much less exciting.

Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old."

Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:

“Mrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”

Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

The ultra conservative Arabian nation that has one of the worst human rights records is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights commission and recently got elected to the Women's Rights Commission as well which sparked anger and protest.

According to HRW the girls were detained for more than a year before the trial and never confessed committing any crime. However the verdict of the ""male only"" Sharia panel was that they need o be executed in accordance with the Sharia law. The boys were only advised ""not to be victimized"" the report further states.





Saudi uses methods such as beheading, stoning and crucifixion to execute women for crimes, including adultery, in the strict Islamic country. Beheadings take place in public squares where the headless corpses are later put on display."

EMT’s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary’s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.

The car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. It’s obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown. The perpetrator fled the scene. The Ford Explorer he was driving had no plates or VIN numbers. Police have impounded it as evidence.

At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.

Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton.

Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillary’s signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.

According to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers.

CTN has censored the couple’s address and the contact information for Hillary’s attorney in the respect of their privacy.

At this time, the Clinton’s are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clinton’s got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard.

The couple’s marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.

It has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they haven’t slept in the same bed for years

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/,www.breitbart.com,775,0,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.

Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.

Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.

Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.

Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.

The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”

According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.

Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion."
BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It,https://web.archive.org/web/20170310140734/http://www.learnprogress.org/trump-caught-investing-pipeline/,web.archive.org,96,0,"CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.

Donald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.

The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.

The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.

Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.

The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.

Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.

And now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.

This should come as no surprise since Trump ‘s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.

This involvement is another example of Trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.

According to Ethics experts, Trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.

The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.

The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police.

We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.

This is great news for American patriots everywhere, and we need to get behind it!

According to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey’s successor, via US Defense Watch.

For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.

More recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump’s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He’s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall.

A long-time favorite of the Tea Party and other conservative groups, Gowdy is the type of man the Trump Administration needs to clean up the leftovers of the Obama Administration and its “Deep State” allies.

Miley Cyrus: 'Donald Trump Is a F--king Nightmare',https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/miley-cyrus-donald-trump-is-a-fking-nightmare-20160302,www.rollingstone.com,597,0,"Donald Trump took a major step toward securing the Republican presidential nomination following the mogul’s Super Tuesday victory, and faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram Tuesday to tell her 38.1 million followers, “Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!”

Cyrus wrote the caption next to a publicity photo of Trump; Cyrus’ Instagram burn has gained 239,000 likes since it was posted Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump’s delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.

Cyrus’ Instagram then took aim at self-proclaimed “most hated woman in the world” Rebecca Francis, a woman who uses her social media to showcase her hunting prowess, and the hunter’s allegiance to Trump.

Cyrus isn’t the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea recently told Rolling Stone, “I can’t take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that he’s a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don’t think he wants to be president, and I don’t think he has a chance to be the president. He’s just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks he’s important.”"

Bill Gates’ Former Doctor Says Billionaire ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children’,https://yournewswire.com/bill-gates-doctor-vaccinate/,yournewswire.com,607,0,"Massachusetts Urged to Pass Sports Betting Bill by New Jersey Governor

Published: June 1, 2022

Author: Dustin Williams

Last Updated: February 6, 2025



New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has become the latest to have his say on the proposal of introducing online sports betting to the state of Massachusetts.

Murphy’s constituency has long been one of the biggest sports betting states in the US and is now advocating that their neighbours embrace the activity. New Jersey was the first US state to record a monthly betting handle in excess of $1 billion in October 2021 and recorded a handle of $1.120 billion in March 2022.

At the time of writing, the only Massachusetts sportsbooks that are available are classed as top offshore betting sites that you can place wagers on via your mobile phone. When asked about the potential of Massachusetts legalizing state-based sports betting, Murphy was emphatic in his answer.

“I’d do it. We’ve long ago beaten Nevada in terms of the monthly handle, and we’ve stayed high even though New York has now legalized.

“We’ve also been able to attract a lot of jobs into New Jersey because it’s a fintech business … It’s been a home run. I wholeheartedly endorse it.”

Previously, the Massachusetts Senate and House passed separate sporting bills that disagreed on a number of different topics. The biggest issue was the stance on wagering on college sports — the Senate were against the idea, while the House was in support of college sports wagering.

This issue could ultimately leave March Madness betting sites and NCAA betting sites out in the cold and leave sports bettors without a significant market to bet on.

Other major differences include the level of tax that they want to charge on retail sports betting. The Senate have agreed on a tax rate of 20% for retail sports betting and 35% for online. The House bill has a lower proposed tax rate of 15% for online and 12.5% for retail.

It has been projected that sports betting could generate $35 million in tax revenue annually in Massachusetts but the Senate and House will need to come to an agreement on their differences first. Should they agree terms, Governor Charlie Baker can then sign the bill into state law.

Baker himself is an advocate of sports betting and feels they are missing out on tax revenue to bordering states. “There are a lot of people who literally drive over the border just to be able to bet on things like the Super Bowl and March Madness and some of the other big events,” he said."

""Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. ""And it's always - always - the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don't think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it's time for that to end.""

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn't going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. ""We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren added. ""Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.""

""We're sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,"" stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he ""doesn't care"" and plans to ""completely ignore"" the Democrats in the nomination process since ""there's nothing they can do"" and he is ""literally unstoppable."""
Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!,https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/head-of-nfl-fines-steeler-teammates-1-million-each/,emsnews.wordpress.com,318,0,"

BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube

The hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?



Alejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube

Kim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.

As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.

Fire chief apologizes for calling Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin ‘n-word’ on Facebook | TribLIVE

Chief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers’ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. “Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,” Smith wrote in the post.Cecil’s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. “The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,” officials said in a written statement.

See? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.

They can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.

Not One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies – Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.

According to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It’s time to cut them off. They don’t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?

The coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary’s run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!

Pushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.

NFL gives up tax exempt status – Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers – Jan. 30, 2015 despite being ‘taxed’ lightly.

Stadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday’s Super Bowl — to the tune of about $300 million.

All this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyed…"
BREAKING: President Trump Signs Executive Order Stripping NFL Of ‘Non-Profit’ Status,https://observeronline.news/president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-of-non-profit-status/,observeronline.news,5,0,"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.

The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.

To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”

The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”

The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”

HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON ‘TOTAL STRIKE’ IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN,https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217/http://nourtey.com/2017/12/30/hollywood-celebs-will-go-total-strike-trump-not-resign/,web.archive.org,293,0,"Many of Hollywood’s elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President.

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.

Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.

“The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,”Mike explained. “And they’re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.”

It’s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren’t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn’t about to change.

Let’s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn’t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump’s goals for his time in office they would feel different

Watch one news network’s story on the matter:"
Trump on Revamping the Military: We’re Bringing Back the Draft,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/04/trump-on-revamping-the-military-were-bringing-back-the-draft/,realnewsrightnow.com,170,0,"COSTA MESA, Ca. - GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.

“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”

Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”

Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”

The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”

Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday."

Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html?_r=0,www.nytimes.com,1636,0,"TBILISI, Georgia — Jobless and with graduation looming, a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America’s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news. He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.

“I don’t know why, but it did not work,” said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real — and completely fake — news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.

More than 6,000 miles away in Vancouver, a Canadian who runs a satirical website, John Egan, had made a similar observation. Mr. Egan’s site, The Burrard Street Journal, offers sendups of the news, not fake news, and he is not trying to fool anyone. But he, too, discovered that writing about Mr. Trump was a “gold mine.” His traffic soared and his work, notably a story that President Obama would move to Canada if Mr. Trump won, was plundered by Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs for their own websites.

“It’s all Trump,” Mr. Egan said by telephone. “People go nuts for it.”

With Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?"

Computer Models Show IRMA Destroying New York City On Sept. 10,https://yournewswire.com/irma-destroy-new-york-city/,yournewswire.com,42,0,"Take a look at our list below of the best New York sportsbooks that the state has to offer. You can also find our collection of the best New York online casinos here.

Sports betting has been on the rise across the US since 2018, and many states have legalized online sports betting since. When looking at sports betting in New York, it’s essential to consider the history of New York’s gambling laws and its stance toward online gambling today.

Bettors in New York now have access to hundreds of online sportsbooks, but how do they know which they can use and which are trustworthy and reliable? We evaluated several aspects of these and compiled a list of the best New York online sportsbooks.

Online Sportsbooks in New York

Although retail sports betting is allowed, real money online sportsbooks within the state have only just started being allowed. After the Supreme Court declared the federal law PASPA unconstitutional in 2018, New York opened its first retail sportsbook in 2019. Several more sportsbooks would open in 2019, followed by 2020, when a bill was proposed to allow online sports betting.

Although the bill never passed, 2021 brought a more open mindset, with New York Governor Cuomo and lawmakers stating their intent to legalize online sports betting. They opened the floor for application requests from interested sportsbooks and received many requests. It was only in January 2022 that they approved four online sportsbooks to launch their online betting platforms and app in New York. We expect to see more online sportsbooks based in New York become available with how things are moving forward.

Other than sportsbooks operating out of New York, offshore sports book are also available. New York bettors can play at many different offshore licensed sportsbooks, as the gambling laws of New York don’t expressly prohibit the use of offshore sportsbooks.

Betting Options

One of the first things we look at when looking for the best New York sportsbook is looking at what betting types they offer. We look for the most popular bet types when evaluating online sportsbooks.

Moneyline Betting

One of the most common and straightforward bets is a money line bet. A money line bet is where you place a wager on who you believe will win the match. The odds are given in the American plus and minus format. The higher the odds, the lower is the individual or team’s chances of winning, while lower odds indicate a higher chance of winning.

The odds also show bettors what they stand to win when betting on a particular team or player. Plus odds like +115 are assigned to the underdogs and mean that if you bet $100, you will win $115 if your bet is successful. Minus odds like -120 are given to the favorites and indicate if you bet $120, you will win $100 if your bet is successful.

Live Betting

Many bettors struggle to bridge the gap between betting in person at a betting shop or racetrack and betting online. Live betting is the way to overcome that gap and have you betting from the comfort of your home while still feeling like part of the action. Bets can be made in real-time after the cutoff time for pre-match bets has passed.

It allows you to make bets based on what is happening during the game and is a great time to start making prop bets. The best New York online sportsbooks also offer HD video streaming technology so that bettors can watch the game as it’s happening and make bets related to the current unfolding of events.

Point Spread

A point spread is like a step up from money line bets, where bookmakers try to average the odds between two teams that are unequal in their ability. If teams initially have vastly different odds like -115 and +120, bookmakers will try to average both teams’ odds to -110 by adding a handicap. This handicap is a margin by which the teams must win or lose for the bet to be successful.

For example, if the point spread odds for Team A are -8.5 (-110), they are the favorites and thus need to win with an 8.5 or more point lead. The underdogs will have +8.5 (-110) odds, meaning they have to lose with a less than 8.5 point difference or win the game for the bet to be successful.

Totals Bet

Also called the Over/Under bet, this bet looks at the total points scored during a match. Bookmakers will offer their odds on the game, meaning what they believe the total points/goals will be scored during a game by both teams. Bettors will bet on whether they believe the total points will be over or under this mark. You will usually see bookmakers setting the total score at a half-point mark to ensure a tie can’t happen.

Let’s look at a match with a total score of 9.5 for its odds. By betting under, the total score needs to be less than 9.5, like if the game ended with a 5/4 score, totaling 9. If you bet over, the total score needs to be more than 9.5, like if the match ended 6/5, giving you a total of 11.

Futures Bet

While it is a long-term investment, futures bets are some of the most popular bet types. Bettors can bet on almost any event in the future, but they will only receive their winnings at the end of the event or season. Futures bets are also good bets to use when making a parlay bet, as you can add several other bet types supporting your futures bet.

A popular example of a futures bet is when you wager on who you believe will win this season’s Super Bowl. The odds on futures bets tend to change often as time goes by, and it’s influenced by how teams are playing and what is happening in the betting market.

Prop Bets

Prop bets remain a fan favorite among bettors, as it makes betting that much more exciting. Bettors who make a bet using this type don’t need to worry about which team wins but rather if their wager’s specific conditions are fulfilled.

It includes bets like which player will score the most goals, how the coin toss will play out, and other such bets. It’s also a popular bet to use when making parlay bets, as it can easily be combined with other bets.

Parlay Bets

Parlay bets are the riskiest bet type but, as a result, one of the most lucrative ones. In a parlay bet, you make multiple bets, usually between two and ten, on one bet slip. If all your bets are successful, you win the entire bet slip and can receive massive returns. However, if even one of your bets on the bet slip results in a loss, then the whole bet slip is void.

If bettors bet on a particular team to win the finals of the Super Bowl, then they can use a parlay bet to make that bet even more lucrative. That’s because you know that to win the finals, you also need to win your first match, semi-final match, etc.

New York Sportsbooks Promotions and Bonuses

With online sportsbooks come betting bonuses and promotions. The most frequently offered bonus is matched deposit bonuses and free bets, with some sportsbooks offering no deposit bonuses. The welcome bonus is generally one of these three types of bonuses.

A matched deposit bonus means that players will have their deposit matched by the casino between 100% and 500% up to a certain amount. They will receive it as bonus funds or free bet credits that they can use to bet on their favorite sports. If a sportsbook offers a 150% bonus up to $900 on your deposit, then if you deposit $10, you’ll receive an extra $15 and can play with $25 altogether. If you deposit $600, you’ll receive $900 and play with $1500. If you deposit more than $600, you won’t receive the 150% equivalent of the amount but rather the maximum bonus amount of $900.

Free bets are similar to bonus funds in that you can use them to bet, but they’re usually given as bet credits or bet tokens players can use. The free bets will have a specific value set by the sportsbook and can be given either as a match deposit bonus or as a no deposit bonus. A no deposit bonus is a bonus you receive without needing to make a deposit and generally is a lower amount, between $5 and $30.

All bonuses also have specific requirements attached to them. This can be a minimum deposit amount, rollover requirements, a bonus expiry period, winnings cap, or any other conditions a bettor must fulfill.

Banking at New York Online Sportsbooks

Playing with real money means many payment methods should be available to New York players. This includes the below popular payment methods.

Credit Cards and Debit Cards

Most online sportsbooks offer Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards, but this deposit method can carry some complications. Due to the UIGEA federal law, some credit card companies don’t allow payments from online gambling service providers, whether legal in the state or not. The payout time for this payment method is generally between three and five days.

Prepaid cards/Play+

One of the most popular payment methods is the Play+ card, linked to the gambling service providers. You can load money onto this card and then use it to deposit funds on the online sportsbook. You can also use it to withdraw your funds and sometimes even present it for payment at establishments that accept Discover. Prepaid cards like Paysafecard are also an accepted deposit method, but it isn’t always available for withdrawals. If it is, the withdrawal limit is usually set relatively low.

PayPal

Arguably the best payment method, PayPal acts as an intermediary between banks, card companies, and gambling service providers. It’s one of the fastest payout methods, generally taking between one and three days. You will also find that PayPal offers low to no transaction fees, making it one of New York bettors’ favorite payment methods. There are plenty of sports bettors that will actively seek out PayPal betting sites to sign up with.

Online Banking

This is the go-to withdrawal method if your deposit method isn’t available for withdrawals. Bank transfers and wire transfers are some of the methods that will almost always be offered. However, it is also one of the methods with the longest payout speed, taking between three and seven days.

PayNearMe

If you don’t want to make an online payment, you can always pop in by certain establishments partnered with online sportsbooks. These are usually shops like 7-Eleven or CVS. You can also go directly to the online sportsbook physical cash cage if they have one. While making deposits and withdrawals this way is fast and easy, you should be aware that a fee usually applies.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is still relatively new to the mainstream but is becoming an increasingly popular option for sports bettors. There are now a number of Bitcoin betting sites available to join, most of which are offshore sites.

Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’,https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601/http://www.snapusanews.com:80/morgan-freeman-jailing-hillary-best-way-to-restore-public-faith-in-govt/,web.archive.org,303,0,"302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”"

"Last in Queen Elizabeth II's line of corgis dies, says British press",https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/europe/queen-last-corgi-dead-intl/index.html,www.cnn.com,70,0,"London CNN —

Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain’s longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog’s death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen’s fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

She received Susan as a gift after becoming attached to her father King George VI’s corgi called Dookie, the Daily Mail reported.

Since then, she has owned dozens of the breed, known for its distinctive short legs and standing-up ears.

Such was Queen Elilzabeth’s attachment to Susan, she reportedly took the dog on honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947.

Leonardo DiCaprio Tells President Obama That He's Going to Mars,https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl,www.inverse.com,280,0,"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.

Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.

DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.

The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”

“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”

As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”

Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.

“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.

It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.

It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.

President Barack Obama, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change. White House

Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said."
White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months,https://halfwaypost.com/2017/07/06/white-house-chef-quits-because-trump-has-only-eaten-fast-food-for-6-months/,halfwaypost.com,51,0,"Photo by Shardar Tarikul Islam on Unsplash



Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”

Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.

“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”

Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.

“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”

No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.

New Jersey couple dies in a home explosion. Caroline Paladino was apparently set to testify to Grand Jury against the Clintons this week..

The expected testimony centered on a notorious pharmaceutical company who gave money to the Clinton Foundation in a bid to cover up their drug price gouging crimes.

According to reports, ‘US Federal Grand Jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by FBI investigators and/or US Attorneys’.

On July 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house. The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.

‘As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database “target hit” on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a “probable witness” against the Clinton Foundation.,

‘Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey—and whose inclusion in the SVR’s database of “potential witnesses” against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine” for the New Jersey Department of Education.’

‘Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)—and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.’

‘Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history—that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the United States—with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their “EpiPen Law” that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.’

‘Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens—became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.—with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin’s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.’

‘To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the United States opioid crisis—that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of America with opioids—and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin’s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.’

‘This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee—and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee—that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State—and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:

“Purdue’s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.

Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative – that long-term use of opioids didn’t create addicts but instead caused “pseudo addictive” symptoms.

The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee’s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.

Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher “quality of life.”

The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin – Purdue’s financial rainmaker – was better for patients than other opioids on the market.”

The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads,http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,www.theverge.com,704,0,"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.

Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. “We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,” Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.

CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.

The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.

This is exactly how fake news spreads

But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh."
Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”,https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424/http://uspoln.com:80/2016/11/14/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love,web.archive.org,183,0,"The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

'The Daily Show's' Michelle Wolf Lands Her Own Netflix Late-Night Show (Exclusive),https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/daily-shows-michelle-wolf-lands-her-own-netflix-late-night-show-1083705,www.hollywoodreporter.com,36,0,"Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.

After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf’s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.

The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: “We’re thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.”

The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (“I want equal pay! And a chardonnay”) to dating and other social issues.

Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.

By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central — and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network’s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.

Looking ahead, Wolf’s Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President’s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.

Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."

"Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Dead, 4 Days Before His 101st Birthday",http://actionnews3.com/legendary-actor-kirk-douglas-dead-age-100/,actionnews3.com,184,0,"News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.

Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016."
JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of “Faking” * 100PercentFedUp.com,https://100percentfedup.com/just-wapo-reporter-broke-news-judge-roy-moore-story-criminal-history-faking/,100percentfedup.com,220,0,"Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.

The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.

One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore “took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.”

Corfman told the Post that Moore “touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.”

The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.

“This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,” Moore said.

Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump’s warning that Moore was less electable.

Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election. – Washington Examiner

Stephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of “faking” things like fake checks for instance…

According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be “fake news, after using mulitple “unnamed sources” in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.

Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.

Ms. McCrummen’s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19 – False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.

Ms. McCrummen’s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states’ criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.

Sean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night. The left is calling for his head today:

When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn’t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40 year old sexual allegation against one of the most hated, Steve Bannon backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?"

BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret,https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952/http://dailyusaupdate.com:80/breaking-clinton-foundation-cargo-ship-raided-port-baltimore-reveals-sick-secret,web.archive.org,912,0,"A ship owned and operated by the Clinton Foundation was raided as it arrived from Africa this morning at the Port of Baltimore. The ship, which was supposed to be carrying “emergency supplies,” was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN:

“We received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didn’t know what to expect, but what we found was simply…surreal. In the middle of the ship’s large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containing…people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.”

Immigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally, not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition, they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each."
"Somali Immigrant Crashes Car Into Ohio Families Home, Killing The Infant At Home",http://dailyheadlines.net/burka-clad-woman-runs-over-baby-gets-away-with-crime-for-1-stunning-reason/,dailyheadlines.net,19,0,"A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.

Muhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.

The man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.

The baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.

A witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.

“Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness,” Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. “But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.”

Mohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.

“If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,” one Mad World News reader commented on the site’s Facebook page. “She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I’m sure she won’t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.”

“Define for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,” another wrote. “Maybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice? If a Caucasian teenager did this… You finish the sentence.”"

She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:

Breaking: Mar-A-Lago Destroyed By Irma-Jared Kushner Still Missing,https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404/http://freedumjunkshun.com:80/mar-a-lago-is-missing-after-kushner-destroyed/,web.archive.org,4,0,"The building Jared Kushner was reportedly in is gone. .

Mar-A-Lago was at the front and center of a rogue wave created by the outer bands of Hurricane Irma. The wave, spanning hundreds of yards across and nearly 20-feet high crashed directly into the Palm Beach estate of President Trump.

Several other properties on either side, including the home of guitar legend Kieth Richards, were also destroyed. The staff at Mar-A-Lago had been sent home except for those who live on the property. They were all in the “safe” building towards the rear of the property when the wave hit.

The building, designed by Eric Trump, was supposed to be able to withstand bunker-busting bombs. He told the National Report that the reason the water was able to penetrate was simple physics:

“I designed the building for an air raid. Who would ever think that the threat would come from the side? Those walls were just normal walls to keep cost down. The roof was what was designed to absorb the impact. Mass equals force times accelarated ions.”

Eric Trump was a decorated mathematician at Oxford and scored well above genius on the Hershman-Rorytar Test. Clearly, the fault for Kushner’s probable fate lies with Kushner himself for not seeking proper shelter."

"Haiti Official Getting Ready To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption NEXT WEEK, Found DEAD With “Gunshot to the head”",https://web.archive.org/web/20180117041602/http://theuspoliticalnews.com:80/haiti-official-getting-ready-to-testify-against-clinton-foundation-corruption-next-week-found-dead-with-gunshot-to-the-head/,web.archive.org,45,0,"It’s absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

“The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.

The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.

“It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire

Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”

He also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.

“Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.”

Melania Trump undergoes kidney surgery at Walter Reed medical center,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/politics/melania-trump-surgery/index.html,www.cnn.com,1111,0,"CNN —

First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.

Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.

“This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,” the first lady’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.

“Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,” Grisham wrote.

President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trump’s surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.

“Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!” Trump tweeted.

Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.

She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.

The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.

Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of “Scandal.”

On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best. She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.

Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump’s husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.

“I am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,” she said. “I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right.”

Melania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks. He was seated in the front row during her Be Best speech, after which he made remarks praising her commitment to helping children, and he was again second to speak, after his wife, during the Military Mothers and Spouses Ceremony on Friday in the White House East Room.

“She’s become a very, very popular first lady. I’m reading that … They love Melania,” the President said. A new CNN poll released May 7 had the first lady’s favorable rating up 10 points since January to 57%.

Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘Gifted’ Children To Human Traffickers,https://yournewswire.com/senate-report-clinton-children-human/,yournewswire.com,109,0,"Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting

Published: September 1, 2022

Author: Dustin Williams

Last Updated: September 1, 2022



The launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports teams.

The sports betting industry fully opened on April 4, giving sports bettors the option to choose between the state-based operators or to continue to use offshore sportsbooks to place their bets online. Those who continued to use the latter will have had an influence on the end results.

Dave Briggs, Managing Editor at PlayCanada.com, the first quarter revenue generated stands at $162 million, converting to around US$125 million. Those figures are pretty modest when compared to the more established sports betting regions such as New Jersey ($557 million), Pennsylvania ($521 million) and Michigan ($466 million).

Although the first reports were slightly underwhelming to some, Briggs was keen to emphasise the influence of offshore operators and that it is still early days.

“Ontario is at a quarter of comparable jurisdictions when I thought it would be half,” Briggs said. “That would be a good start, a decent start.

“Part of that is, of course, it’s the first three months. They’re just getting started and not everybody is in. I didn’t expect we’d rival any of those (top-three jurisdictions) but we also have an established gambling industry in Ontario and we have 15 million people so it’s not like it’s a brand new market and it’s not small.”

Ontario boasts a bigger population than Pennsylvania (13m), Michigan (10m) and New Jersey (9m), but their revenue figures were just 24%, 27% and 22% of those respective states’ numbers. it should be noted, however, that the record-high Ontario Lottery numbers haven’t been included in the report.

The next report will also feature the months of July, August and September, with the former two being traditionally the quietest months of the year where there is a lack of major sports such as the NFL, NBA and NHL. The return of the NFL season, especially, should have a positive impact on future numbers across the winter.

“You’ll get a kick, for sure,” Baggs added. “But I think you’ll see a definite increase in the third quarter when the NFL is in full swing and we’ll also have the World Series, which is reasonably well bet.

“The fourth (quarter) is that winter period where you’ve got football playoffs and the Super Bowl, which is going to be the biggest one, you’re going to have March Madness, you’re going to have NHL and NBA playoffs.”"

Last Updated: September 14, 2022



Amazon’s Thursday Night Football broadcasts will exclusively use betting odds provided by DraftKings after the two parties agreed terms on a multi-year deal.

The deal will see DraftKings produce pre-game content for fans and will begin on Thursday, September 15 for the Los Angeles Chargers’ game versus the Kansas City Chiefs at SoFi Stadium and will continue throughout all 15 of their remaining Thursday night broadcasts in the 2022 season.

It will also see fans have access to new betting offers dedicated to every game that can be accessed by residents of states where the best sportsbooks are legal. According to Sportico, the door is also open for further collaborations such as an alternate betting stream to be set up.

“The NFL season is the most active time of year for our customers, so collaborating with one of the world’s leading technology brands in order to offer engaging content to viewers of TNF on Prime Video is a tremendous opportunity for DraftKings,” Stephanie Sherman, Chief Marketing Officer of DraftKings, said in a media release.

“Prime Video is an innovator in live content and we both have a similar focus on constantly improving our customers’ experiences. We look forward to working with Amazon to bring millions of viewers a premium and enhanced experience during TNF on Prime Video all season long and for years to come.”

The betting options available to Amazon viewers include same-game parlays on the upcoming game and pre-game odds on selected wagers. The return of football always comes with huge excitement as it starts the busiest time of the year for NFL sportsbooks across the country.

The NFL regular season, combined with the return of the NBA and MLB playoffs, makes this annually the most profitable quarter for betting sites in the U.S.

Danielle Carney, head of NFL sales at Amazon Ads, added: “We are thrilled to collaborate with DraftKings to bring fans more insights and excitement as part of the TNF viewing experience.

“DraftKings content will contribute to lively pregame discussions, fan engagement and, perhaps, some bold predictions from our on-air talent.”"
Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby,https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/,notallowedto.com,5,0,"De Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.

According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.

Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.

The 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.

“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.

The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.

“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment."
Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/,www.breitbart.com,378,0,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.

Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.

Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.

In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.

A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.

“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.

Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.

The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.

But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.

The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.

Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing."
10 Things You Didn't Know About Nancy Pelosi,https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2006/11/07/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-nancy-pelosi,www.usnews.com,1020,0,"Jim Lo Scalzo for USN&WR

1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.

2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.

3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.

4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.

5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.

6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.

7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.

8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.

9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.

10. A true San Franciscan, Pelosi makes sure that her office is stocked with Ghirardelli chocolates. Her diet typically consists of mostly chocolate and chocolate ice cream. Completing the notoriously challenging New York Times crossword puzzle is one of her favorite hobbies.

WE CALLED IT!

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” that she added “notes,” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

GMA : “Nelson says she did make notes to [Moore’s] inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.” ABC HOST: “Beverly, he did sign your yearbook.” NELSON: “He did sign it.” ABC HOST: “And you made some notes underneath?” NELSON: “Yes.”

Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it “sickens” her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017

As The Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft reported, there are growing calls that Gloria Allred and Beverly Nelson should be charged with fraud.

And in case you missed it… The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly Nelson’s press conference.

Following The Gateway Pundit’s viral story on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Strangely, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is written in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin. Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud."

Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents,https://medium.com/@bobcrane_55517/breaking-news-fbi-uncovers-evidence-that-62-million-trump-voters-are-all-russian-agents-bc33994a4286,medium.com,530,0,"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents

Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.

This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.

It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.

It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.

“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”

When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”

NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”

The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.

You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns."

82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty,https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/82-year-old-who-killed-a-muslim-in-self-defense-gets-the-death-penalty/,web.archive.org,25,0,"82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”

Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?

DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”

DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.

"A fake photo of Emma González went viral on the far right, where Parkland teens are villains",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/03/25/a-fake-photo-of-emma-gonzalez-went-viral-on-the-far-right-where-parkland-teens-are-villains/?utm_term=.a8127cdbabea,www.washingtonpost.com,811,0,"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday. Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.

González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior and survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting delivered the final speech at Washington's March for Our Lives on March 24. (Video: The Washington Post)

Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.

Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.

A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.

The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.

The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.

He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.

Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.

The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.

Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.

Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.

Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.

They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.

The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.

Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.

For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.

“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.

As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).

“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.

A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.

“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.

Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.

But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.

Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.

Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.

“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.

Target to Discontinue Sale of Holy Bible,http://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-conservative/2016/05/target-to-discontinue-sale-of-holy-bible-3139296.html,beforeitsnews.com,468,0,"



Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.

Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”

If released by the committee, the bill is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated or amended. If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill. Finally, a conference committee made of House and Senate members works out any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. The Government Publishing Office prints the revised bill in a process called enrolling.

Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Pelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.” :

“We’re not interested in defending our actions or our values as human beings. I’m a public servant who will continue to serve until my health or my constituents say otherwise.”

Regardless of how much we hate Nacy Pelosi, she represents a Congressional District that saw a million fraudulent votes from illegal immigrants. She’ll hold that seat until she dies.

Mueller, on the other hand, is looking at a messy divorce, a public humiliation and the loss of his job. He’ll also go down in history as the man who had solid evidence against several Trump surrogates and allowed their cases to all be dismissed on a technicality. None of it would have led to Trump, but it still lifts a huge weight from his legacy.

BREAKING: US comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after gory car crash,https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938/http://nydailynews-tv.com:80/breaking-us-comedian-kevin-hart-in-critical-condition-after-gory-car-crash/,web.archive.org,0,0,"Comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after a single-car accident in Summerlin, Las Vegas Monday morning.

According to the police, Hart lost control of his car and went off the east side of the road and his car crashed head-on into a guardrail while he was driving at a high speed.

Metro Police said 38-year-old US comedian and film star Kevin Hart, was driving faster than the 25 mph speed limit while going north on Spring Gate Lane about 8:20 a.m today.

The undisputed king of comedy, as at the time of filing this report, remained in critical condition at MountainView Hospital in Summerlin, police can confirm.

Drugs and alcohol were not factors in the crash, police said.

A day before this tragic incident, comedian Kevin Hart posted a candid social media message confessing that he made a “bad error in judgement” which recently led to an undisclosed individual making an extortion attempt against him.

In an Instagram video, Hart said that, though he had never claimed to be perfect, he had recently put himself “in an environment where only bad things would happen”.

“I’m not perfect, I’m not gonna sit up here and claim that I am in any shape or form, and I made a bad error in judgement,” he told his followers. “In doing that, I know I’m going to hurt the people closest to me, who I’ve talked to and apologised to, them being my wife and my kids, and you know; it’s a shitty moment.”

Hart then explained that he had chosen to “‘fess up” rather than have someone attempt to make “financial gain from [his] mistakes. In this particular situation, that’s was what was attempted.”"
Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A “Dream”,https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/,sentinelksmo.org,122,0,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.

A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.

The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.

When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”

The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”

K.S. replied, “Correct.”

The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”

K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”

Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”

Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”

K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.

As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.

Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it."
"Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDA’s ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccines",https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm598317.htm,www.fda.gov,27,0,"For Immediate Release: February 26, 2018 Statement From: Scott Gottlieb, M.D.





Español

The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.

As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.

As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.

Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2

There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.

While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.

So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?

We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.

However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.

Working to determine the root causes

Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.

What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.

The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.

Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season

While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.

In the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. It’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.

The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

"No, Sandra Bullock didn't disparage Hillary Clinton",http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/,www.politifact.com,4,0,"A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.

""Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’"" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.

While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.

The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.

At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.

""I don’t agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.""

The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.

""I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,"" she says. ""When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.""

We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton ""if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again."" We rate this headline Pants on Fire."
"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist’",http://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist/,babylonbee.com,1,0,"MAYADIN, SYRIA - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ""The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.""

The powerful statement which single-handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people, and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group's jihad finished.

""Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world, I just can't deny that Katy's words have touched my heart,"" al-Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK-47 onto the ground. ""It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people.""

""I just can't believe we didn't see it before. It's all so clear now,"" he added.

After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.

According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace."
Tens of Thousands Of Scientists Declare Climate Change A Hoax,https://yournewswire.com/tens-of-thousands-of-scientists-declare-climate-change-a-hoax/,yournewswire.com,1893,0,"March Madness is one of the biggest sporting events in the American sports calendar each year. The one-and-done nature of the NCAA Basketball National Championship has made it one of the most interesting sporting events to bet on too, while many will try and pick the perfect bracket for the chance to win huge real money prizes.

Every year, millions of sports fans hunch over an impossible, hypothetical question: what are the odds of picking March Madness perfect bracket? The answer, of course, isn’t exact; you could fill a hundred brackets with random mascots and still be likely to lose (the less said about this possibility, the better). And yet it’s a question that gets tossed around the water cooler every March.

The NCAA basketball tournament is upon us, and everyone loves bracket pools. Bracket pools aren’t just for office environments. You can now place a bracket pool on your blog or website. The odds of picking a perfect bracket for the NCAA Tournament are almost one in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.

To put that into perspective, the world population is roughly 7 billion people. That means it would take about 3 billion people guessing against each other for 18 million years to figure out a perfect bracket. So let’s take a look at the odds of picking that ideal bracket and what you’ll need to potentially become the next millionaire from winning your office pool at one of a number of sports betting sites that allow you to compete by choosing your bracket.

Odds of Picking the Perfect Bracket

Does the thought of filling out a bracket for March Madness give you anxiety? As it turns out, the odds are pretty good that you will get at least one game wrong. The odds of picking a March Madness perfect bracket are heavily stacked against you in filling out a perfect bracket for the NCAA basketball tournament.

Best teams. Biggest upsets. Most buzzer-beaters. You know it all means one thing: March Madness is here! With college basketball season in full swing, millions of fans are gearing up to fill out their brackets for the big tournament and cash in on that sweet ESPN bonus prize money. But before you go ahead and send your picks in, consider this: how likely is it that you’ll correctly pick the entire bracket?

What Are The Odds Of Getting All 63 Games Correct?

The answer is one in 128 billion. That’s almost two quadrillion times less likely than winning the lottery. It’s not just basketball that has billions of possible outcomes, even last year’s Super Bowl had 256 possible scenarios. You could try your hand at picking every single one of them and you’d still only have a one in 256 chance of success.

Why does March Madness get so much hype? Because it’s exciting. Even if your bracket does fail, you can watch how other brackets turn out on various sports apps. The thrill of it all is addictive and it gets people talking about you!

This year’s March Madness bracket is a little different than most. It’s not just about figuring out which team will win each game and making your picks. It’s about getting every single pick correct, the 63 games you have to predict correctly to win the bracket challenge. This seems like far too many games to get right and we figured out the likelihood of actually doing that, it’s 0.01%.

In short, you’re probably not going to win your office bracket challenge this year. You’re not going to get every single one of these right. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try!

Tips to Improve Odds and Win Maximum Games

As March Madness approaches, your office should be getting increasingly loud as everyone gets into their brackets and starts to argue over who’s going to win and why. But the question that’s on everyone’s mind is, “what are the basic strategies for winning March Madness?”

The answer is a little complicated because there are so many factors involved. Are you playing in a pool with your friends? Are you in a big office pool? Are you one of the 2% of people picking correctly and will get this done right? Well, here’s what to do:

Study up on all the teams! Your office pool has spreadsheets for every sport. That spreadsheet will have research on all participating teams. Get familiar with the teams that can go far and those who have a good shot at getting out early. The farther they go, the higher your chances of winning a prize, so study up! Remember: it’s all about strategy.

Learn how scoring works! This is easy enough. You get 1 point for every pick you submit before anyone else does, but then you lose that point if someone else submits that team before you do. So make sure you’re submitting picks early, so you don’t lose them!

Pick Against the Highest Seed!

The most commonly used method is to choose the top seeds. It’s simple and a good strategy, but it doesn’t win. Only about 2% of people who try this strategy win their bracket.

For any other bracketologists out there, here are some tips to help you win:

1. Choose upsets to succeed but make sure that each upset has a reasonable chance of happening! If you have an upset, that’s too unlikely to happen; it’ll be scored as a loss anyway. Being overly risky will only cause you to lose more points!

2. Learn which teams tend to do well in tournament play and carefully choose them (or their opponents). For example, Villanova has done very well in the tournament lately, so they may be worth picking if you’re going for upsets (but beware, they could lose early).

3. Be prepared for the unexpected! Pick a few teams that you think could beat anyone in this year’s tournament, and pick them at every step of the way. This could be a great way to rack up points if your favorite team makes it far into the tournament or even wins it all!

Top Tips For Betting Right

Pick The Team You Think Will Win, Not The One You Want To Win

This strategy is essential because it helps bettors avoid “picking favorites” or rooting for a particular team based on their geographic location, school mascot, or what color jersey they wear. These types of biases can lead a bettor to overestimate or underestimate a team’s chances of winning based on factors that do not relate directly to how well that team is playing at any given moment. A bettor looking at things objectively will not let bias cloud what they know about each team’s strengths and weaknesses.

Focus on Strong Teams

Why focus on teams who finished strong to Win March madness? Historically, teams that finished the regular season strong have won the NCAA tournament.

The top 5 finishers of each region in the tournament are:

Villanova Wildcats

Kansas Jayhawks

Wisconsin Badgers

Virginia Tech Hokies

Florida State Seminoles

Villanova is a #1 seed and is favored to win the tournament. They finished the season strong. They also have an impressive offense and defense. They have a good mix of sophomores and upperclassmen, which gives them experience and leadership.

Kansas is also expected to go deep into the tournament. They have a great offense and defense, however, not as strong as Villanova’s.

Check RPI

One of the best measures of each team’s schedule strength is its RPI—the Rating Percentage Index. The RPI is used to rank college basketball teams in the NCAA. It includes:

Opponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team has played, using the most recent data available (e.g., if you’re trying to calculate RPI going into March Madness, you’ll use opponents’ winning percentages from games they’ve played up until that point).

Opponents’ opponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team’s opponents have played, using the most recent data available.

In other words, how well are those who you play against playing overall? The NCAA considers your schedule to be more challenging based on your RPI.

When your favorite basketball team is heading into the Big Dance, you want to be sure it’s got a strong schedule. That’s where the Strength of Schedule (SOS) metric comes in. You should make a full-season projection for all teams and then use those projections to simulate each game of the season thousands of times. SOS simulates the importance of each game in both the overall record and conference record.

You then take SOS and combine it with power rankings to create an overall ranking. This allows you to compare teams from different conferences. Bettors have been using this method for years and have accurately predicted 11 out of 14 champions.

Innovative Strategies To Win The Pool

Most people have never won their office March Madness pool. They don’t have basketball analytics degrees and aren’t professional gamblers. That said, there are some things you can keep in mind when filling out your bracket to increase your chances of pulling an upset.

First, research! Find out what teams have the best high-scoring offenses and look for potential matchups against defenses that struggle to stop opponents from scoring. It’s also a good idea to follow individual players on social media. That way, you’ll get a sense of their personalities and chemistry as a team.

Another tip is to pay attention to injuries that could affect certain players’ games. While it might seem tempting to pick all No. 1 seeds or all lower seeds, those are harder to win with because the top seeds always win – but if you’re thinking about picking all upsets (which isn’t necessarily a bad strategy), then go for it! The most important thing is that you have fun! Good luck!

Is It Important to Pick Upsets?

Most people fill out a bracket for the NCAA tournament based on their knowledge of the teams and their players, but that’s not the best method. Instead, there’s a better method: picking upsets! When filling out your bracket, you want to pick upsets. Brackets that win are often ones that choose some long-shot teams to win.

If you want to pick upsets when you fill out your NCAA men’s basketball tournament bracket, here are some tips:

Don’t be afraid to pick the 12-seed over the 5-seed (or vice versa)

Use power rankings to help you make upset picks

Pick teams that have been having hot streaks recently

Keep things even by picking an upset in every game (don’t just make one team lose after another team loses)

There are a lot of upsets that happen in March Madness each year, and if you’re smart about it and know how to choose them, you can have a great shot at winning your pool!

How do you pick an upset in the first round? These are some tips:

1) A team with a player who has injured themselves during or just after tournament play is more likely to upset a higher seed.

2) If a team has won its first game, they are likely to upset a higher seed.

3) In general, if the score is close at halftime and not by a lot in the end, that’s going to be an upset.

4) If one team has more players on it than another and the smaller team wins, that’s an upset, too.

5) Teams seeded 7th or worse can beat teams seeded better than them, especially if they’re playing against teams from their region with higher seeds.

Tips To Fill Your First Bracket

March Madness is one of the most widely-viewed sporting events in the world. There are a few tips you should keep in mind for those new to March Madness and filling out their first bracket.

The first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with the competing teams. You should be able to identify which schools and conferences are involved; look at each team’s win-loss record, and identify any major stories that may have affected a team or coach during the season (for instance, injuries or transfers).

The second thing you should do is consider what others think of each team. Specifically, you should pay attention to the predictions of sports analysts, sportscasters, and your friends who typically fill out brackets.

Conclusion

In the age of “bracketology,” March Madness is not just about which team wins, but whether anyone can pick a perfect NCAA tournament bracket. This task seems next to impossible. One look at the odds shows why: 999,964,129 to 1, for every person in the United States.

Various factors determine what makes a March Madness bracket. The player stats and team records will be the most critical parts of your college basketball bracket. But you can’t forget about injuries, suspensions, previous matchups, and home-court advantage. What’s more, there are also a lot of potential upsets, so try not to pick too many in your final four! Bracketology is as much of an art as science, despite what the numbers say.

The odds are so insane that the state of mathematical probability ceases to be a factor. Most years, even a McDonald’s fry cook would be better off skipping work and betting everything on his bracket."

Information for the Nation,http://theseattletribune.com/idaho-mother-sentenced-prison-multiple-citations-public-breastfeeding/,theseattletribune.com,170,0,"The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues.

This muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding:

Anabolic Drugs Or Steroids

Anabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain.

These hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein.

Beta-2 Agonists

These synthetic drugs help expand the lungs’ capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.

Human Growth Hormone

Also referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH.

Ephedrine

Bodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles.

Methenolone

Methenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it.

Trenbolone Acetate

When looking to increase muscle mass and strength quickly, many athletes turn to trenbolone acetate, a highly potent anabolic steroid. If you’re wondering where to buy trenbolone acetate, it’s crucial to source from reputable suppliers to ensure the quality and authenticity of the product."

Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the Country,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651,www.nbcnews.com,117,0,"An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

""Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself."""
BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Has Third Heart Attack-Docs Says She ‘Won’t Survive’,https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757/http://politicspaper.com:80/breaking/breaking-hillary-clinton-third-heart-attack-docs-says-wont-survive/,web.archive.org,0,0,"Hillary Clinton had a third and most-likely fatal heart attack this afternoon after spending the morning being told she’d be getting better. It almost seems fitting that the last thing she hears is a lie about her own well-being.

The Butcher of Benghazi will meet her maker, says Doctor Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as the damage to her heart is irreparable at this point:

“Secretary Clinton fought hard but today her fight is over. We predict she’ll be at rest within hours.”

The Clinton family has asked for privacy and wouldn’t answer questions about whether or not they had to decide to “pull the plug” or if they’re simply being told nothing can be done. Chelsea Clinton was seen entering the hospital in tears shortly after noon, according to a new report from LLOD correspondent Skip Tetheluda:

“Chelsea came alone and was obviously distraught. She made no comment to the press but did stop to tell one photographer to have some respect while she ‘visits a great woman for the last time.’ She hasn’t come out and is presumably sitting and waiting to say goodbye. Bill Clinton is sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.”

We’ll update you as soon as we confirm that Clinton has gone on to answer for her crimes with an eternity in Hell."
Lindsey Graham Threatens To Convert To Democrat If Republicans Don’t Dump Trump – True Trumpers,https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001/http://truetrumpers.com/lindsey-graham-threatens-to-convert-to-democrat-if-republicans-dont-dump-trump,web.archive.org,238,0,"During a time when the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between Republicans and Americans alike.

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”

“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.

“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”

Although many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump’s accusations, they continue to support him."

WE WILL RIOT!

Michelle Obama’s Mom Will Receive $160k Every Year Out Of Taxpayers’ Pockets!

This amount of corruption is a next level thing that we haven’t seen portrayed this nonchalantly before. Namely, Michelle Obama’s mom failed to earn a pension that’s three times the amount of an average American family’s whole income!

It appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the Obama’s never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.

Congress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.

First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.

As concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s eight years in office.

Michelle Obama’s mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?

How pathetic excuse is that?

"BREAKING: Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate",https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/breaking-trump-fires-deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-raising-questions-over-muellers-fate/,web.archive.org,0,0,"WASHINGTON — Rod Jay Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice has been removed from his office.

Nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General and the official overseeing the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, has a reputation for integrity.

Rod who is described by Jim Trusty, the former head of the Justice Department’s organized-crime division as a prosecutor, not a persecutor, had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller’s probe, so the only possible way is to throw the Justice Department into upheaval by firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who only holds the key Mueller’s expulsion.

Only the person acting as attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe, could fire Mueller, and he said he won’t do it without “good cause.” So Trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the Justice Department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel.

Conflicting reports claim Rosenstein had resigned but it’s understood that Donald Trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff, John Kelly.

UNDER the best of circumstances—when America has a president who is disciplined, willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he trusts—the post of Attorney General is “perhaps one of the most powerful job in Washington”, according to Loretta Lynch. Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, an American attorney who served as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to succeed Eric Holder. Loretta Lynch, a political giant who held that post for Barack Obama said, under ideal conditions, it is also the “toughest job in government.”

Rosenstein, the hapless establishment Republican ousted as Deputy Attorney General on Monday December 4, 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days. After days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of Mueller’s dismissal by Trump and amidst Trump’s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, Mr Rosenstein is being replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who was recently nominated by Trump for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court.

The reshuffle puts Mr Rosenstein out of his misery and confirms Mr Trump’s fondness for surrounding himself with tough-as-nails generals, who already fill several top jobs in his government. It ends the fear of Trump administration being damaged by Flynn’s plea to Mueller’s investigation team.

These are not anything like ideal circumstances for Mr Neil Gorsuch. New holder of the toughest job in government, the ex-clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992, and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, from 1993 to 1994. He currently was serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. How long Mr Neil Gorsuch lasts is anyone’s guess. If he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of Trump’s administration, he will have done better than his predecessor.

President Donald Trump’s interview with the New York Times on Wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller for investigating Trump’s business dealings as part of the Russia probe.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller’s probe. Firing the Deputy Attorney General simply means setting off a chain-reaction that would throw the Justice Department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire Robert Mueller under his dictatorship.

He’d certainly begun by dismissing Rosenstein, whose political loyalties Trump questioned in the Times interview on Wednesday in which he also warned Mueller against broadening his investigation. Such a scenario would parallel President Richard Nixon’s 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre,” when Nixon forced out the top two officials in the Justice Department in order to oust the Watergate special counsel.

“I don’t think that’s politically survivable, and it’s not clear how much collateral damage he will do, putting himself into a position to have somebody fire Mueller,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island.

Expanding Investigation

Mueller’s investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the president’s businesses, including dealings by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg News. Trump told the Times that if Mueller examined his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia he’d consider it “a violation.”

“There is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller,” said Senate Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican. “I don’t even want to comment on that because that’s so far out of bounds it couldn’t possibly be a serious discussion.”

Undercutting Mueller

Trump has indicated he would try to undercut Mueller’s credibility. In the New York Times interview, Trump said Mueller has “many other conflicts that I haven’t said, but I will at some point.”

Separately, the Washington Post reported Thursday night that Trump’s legal team was exploring ways to question Mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation. The Post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that Trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members or even himself."

Archbishop Desmond Tutu dies while holidaying in Texas,https://web.archive.org/web/20180424001608/http://nytimes-news.com/archbishop-desmond-tutu-dies-while-holidaying-in-texas/,web.archive.org,0,0,"HOUSTON, TEXAS – Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, Tutu’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as “evil”, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world – principally for his role in South Africa’s struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime – and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, “the Arch” – as he was known – had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson Mandela’s 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the world’s most pressing problems.

Paul Ryan: “Donald Trump Plans To Resign From Office Within The Next 30 Days”,https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142109/http://stgeorgegazette.com:80/trump-plans-to-resign-within-30-days,web.archive.org,29,0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.

“Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,” Ryan told reporters. “Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.”







News of this comes as Russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.

“If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. “Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.”

Donald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.

“We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you’ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!”

“We think this is the best thing,” Ryan continued. “He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.”

After word spread of Trump’s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.







“I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he’s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.”

Lloyd Glacier, a spokesman for ‘Sock It Forward‘, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump’s plan to resign.

“This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.”

38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.

“When I’m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,” Horner said. “Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country.

GOP Official Who Says America Needs ?Another 9/11?

To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important…if you haven’t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!

And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming “hoaxes.” He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka’s merchandise (they were, that’s why they pulled the line).

The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That’s right, he tweeted “Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.”

Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.

This is terrifying, and there’s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but aren’t quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!"

With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

Elton John

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

Andrea Bocelli

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

open image in gallery

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend

open image in gallery

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get."""
"3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes",https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/,notallowedto.com,103,0,"

Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

Canadian tourist, John O’Keef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.

“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.

“I’d heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,” claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.

The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.

Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: “This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.

According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.

U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.

In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.

“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

"BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Every WORKING, LEGAL Man Woman And Child In The USA $612 EACH! -",https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139/http://usadailypost.us:80/2017/02/14/breaking-trump-just-gave-every-working-legal-man-woman-child-usa-612,web.archive.org,123,0,"If you’re not a lazy bum on welfare or an illegal here to steal food stamps and free medicine, President Trump has some good news for you. You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.

The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:

While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don’t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:

“It’s not that much money in the grand scheme. We’ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we’ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. It’s be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.”

One thing is for sure. You can forget about all the stupidity the liberals are trying to sell you about lies and Russians and North Korea and all the rest of the humdrum day to day you shouldn’t concern yourself with anyway. What a waste of time. Grab some cash and have some fun on your leader, Donald Trump!

Checks will start arriving in the mail Friday.

The first family visited Friendship Place, which is located in the basement of St. Luke’s Church in Northwest Washington. The shelter, which received a $3.1 million grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs this year to improve its capacity to address veteran homelessness, operates the program Veterans First, a leading provider of housing services to veterans and their families in the area that currently serves 550 households.

The Obamas, along with some friends, served dinner as part of the shelter's ""Feast with Friends"" event. Each member of the family had assigned duties: The president served turkey and ladled gravy; Michelle Obama distributed vegetables; Malia doled out mashed potatoes; Sasha gave out stuffing and cranberry sauce and Marian Robinson dished out macaroni and cheese.

""We appreciate you,” the president said, asking another, “How you been?""

Obama also asked those partaking in the meal if they preferred white or dark meat.

The White House, which first launched an effort to end homelessness in June 2010, has intensified its push targeting homeless veterans this year. The mayors of the 25 cities with the largest populations of homeless veterans in the nation have publicly pledged to end veteran homelessness in their communities by the end of this year, and Virginia announced on Veterans Day it had become the first state to end homelessness among those who have served in the military."

“He saved my life,” Heather Gulish Melton told USA Today. “He grabbed me from behind and started running when I felt him get shot in the back.

USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption,https://newstarget.com/2016-02-23-usda-approves-slaughterhouses-producing-horse-meat-for-human-consumption.html,newstarget.com,265,0,"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

Thinking about writing in a candidate on Election Day?

Darrell Castle, the candidate for the Constitution Party, is on the ballot in more than two dozen states. Castle said his campaign has faced ballot access obstacles in California, Texas and Oklahoma. “Those states are virtually impossible for a party like mine because they cost so much money,” Castle said.

Castle isn’t on the ballot in Oklahoma. To be on the ballot there required signatures from at least 3 percent of all votes cast in the state in 2012, or about 40,000 signatures. Castle says this would likely require hiring professionals who often charge a few dollars for each signature.

Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016:

""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam.""

"Democrats go full TYRANNY: Now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans… at gunpoint, of course",http://revolutionradio.org/2018/05/07/democrats-go-full-tyranny-now-demand-nationwide-gun-confiscation-from-law-abiding-americans-at-gunpoint-of-course/,revolutionradio.org,0,0,"by: Ethan Huff

Monday, May 07, 2018

A California Democrat was recently given a platform by USA Today to publish a shocking editorial that calls for nationwide confiscation of all “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons” from law-abiding citizens.

Representative Eric Swalwell from California’s 15th District wrote that all so-called “assault” weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry.

Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their “assault” weapons be criminally prosecuted – including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry.

Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new “assault” weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.

“Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed,” Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. “This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.”

“Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.”

Democrats like Rep. Swalwell are enemies of the Constitution, and enemies of We the People

Colorado Rockies Baseball Team To Sell Marijuana Brownies At Their Concession Stands,http://www.empiresports.co/colorado-rockies-baseball-team-to-sell-marijuana-brownies-at-their-concession-stands/,www.empiresports.co,240,0,"In the wake of groundbreaking legislation in Colorado, the sporting world is poised at the threshold of a new era, seeking innovative avenues to integrate the state’s newly legalized cannabis into the fan experience. This forward-thinking approach is emblematic of a broader shift towards the acceptance and commercialization of cannabis within mainstream sectors, including the realm of major sports.

The Rockies’ Pioneering Initiative

Leading the charge in this unprecedented venture is Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies, who are reportedly setting the stage to incorporate cannabis-infused edibles into their game-day offerings. This initiative, marking a significant departure from traditional concession fare, underscores a willingness to adapt and cater to evolving consumer preferences and legal landscapes.

At the forefront of the Rockies’ innovative concession lineup stands a quintessential edible that has long been synonymous with cannabis cuisine: the pot brownie. This move, confirmed by insiders within the Rockies organization, signals not just a nod to the changing legalities but a bold embrace of the cultural and culinary potential that legal cannabis holds within the context of sports entertainment.

Strategic Integration and Fan Engagement

The decision to introduce marijuana-infused brownies at concession stands is more than a novelty; it represents a strategic foray into enhancing the fan experience, aligning with the broader trends of experiential engagement that major sports organizations are increasingly prioritizing. This initiative also reflects a nuanced understanding of the demographic shifts and changing societal attitudes towards cannabis.

The Rockies’ venture into cannabis-infused concessions navigates a complex web of legal, ethical, and logistical considerations. This pioneering approach is predicated on a rigorous adherence to state laws and regulations surrounding the sale and consumption of cannabis, ensuring a responsible and compliant integration of these products into the public sphere of major league sports.

A Catalyst for Industry-Wide Innovation

The Rockies’ embrace of cannabis-infused concessions could serve as a catalyst for broader innovation within the sports industry, challenging other organizations to rethink their engagement strategies and concession offerings. This move is indicative of the potential for sports venues to become arenas for not only athletic competition but also for culinary and cultural experimentation.

The introduction of cannabis edibles at sports events heralds a shift in the consumption habits and cultural norms associated with sporting events. This initiative has the potential to redefine the parameters of the game-day experience, offering fans novel ways to engage with the event and with each other, within the bounds of a legal and regulated framework.

Looking to the Future

As the Colorado Rockies lead the way in integrating cannabis into the sports fan experience, the industry watches with keen interest. This bold step not only reflects the changing landscape of legal cannabis but also sets a precedent for how major sports organizations can innovate and adapt in response to shifting societal norms and legalities."
THIS ARTICLE RETRACTED: Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma,https://news.antiwar.com/2018/04/09/red-crescent-says-no-evidence-of-chemical-attack-in-syrias-douma/,news.antiwar.com,120,0,"Update:

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.

—

The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.

The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.

(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)

Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.

The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack."
Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671,www.nbcnews.com,13,0,"Convicted church shooter Dylann Roof has been transferred to death row at Terre Haute Federal Prison in Indiana — the facility that houses male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.

Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show.

Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates.

In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.

He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.

Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

Read more about the lethal injection controversy here

As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 — drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.

Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his ""unique"" security arrangements.

After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.

Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon.

Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment"" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected."
"The pro-Russia, pro-weed, pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beat",http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/The-pro-Russia-pro-weed-pro-Assange-GOP-12195944.php,www.sfchronicle.com,0,0,"Dana Rohrabacher Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call,Inc.

Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle Rep. Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle

COSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.

Then again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”

He’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”

If you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher explains how he knew when America won the Cold War as he makes peanut butter sandwiches in his Costa Mesa home. Joe Garofoli / San Francisco Chronicle

Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.

It won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.

That’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.

Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”

Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?

“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”

“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.

One of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.

Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.

Rohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.

“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.

Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”

Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.

Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.

Plus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.

“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”

Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.

But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.

And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.

UPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations,https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934/http://nofakenews.online/update-van-full-of-illegals-caught-voting-at-multiple-alabama-polling-locations/,web.archive.org,158,0,"The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become Alabama’s next senator.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.

“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”

Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.

This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

All but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.

How many other dirty tricks will be exposed?"
"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress",http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-will-testify-before-congress.html,nymag.com,1026,0,"Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”

Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.

Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”

Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.

Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action."

AND THE REASONING IS, HE’S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”

O’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”

“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.

“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.

And Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:

If President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.

Langone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.

Voters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.

Langone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. “We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].”

“If you guys don’t get your guys into a room and say ‘Guys this is our moment.’ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,” he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on “Squawk Box.”

“[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever” if he’s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.

“The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don’t want incremental change. They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies

The Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.



Many retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.

But Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”

Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.

This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

One of these days the Democrats will realize they can’t keep up with the winning strategy of the Republican party. It doesn’t matter how many more votes the Dems get, the GOP continues to grow stronger. With Schumer out of the way it will grow even stronger. The alleged file on Franken includes things like pushing entitlement programs that are meant to give away free stuff for votes and adultery.

President Trump doesn’t mess around.

Little Terrence disappeared earlier today from the Capitol building, and didn’t manage to make it fat before his young life was shut by forces of globalist.

Congressman Trey Gowdy and his family did not come up with a statement. They ask for privacy and they are taking some family time in order to deal with the tragic loss of their son. His family and he, are at a high-security safehouse in an unknown location, so they can protect themselves.

BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi Was Just Taken From Her Office In Handcuffs,https://web.archive.org/web/20170310212116/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-nancy-pelosi-was-just-taken-from-her-office-in-handcuffs/,web.archive.org,378,0,"Liberal menace and purveyor of lies, Nancy Pelosi (D-California), was just taken from her office in handcuffs by the United States Secret Service. While little information is available as of yet, one agent did tell a reporter for the Washington Examiner that the arrest came at the direct order of the president:

“Mrs. Pelosi’s arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,” said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, “She’s wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. That’s all we’re authorized to say at this time.”

The White House OIP has confirmed that report, calling Pelosi a usurper and a threat to the office of President Trump:

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi’s arrest for conspiacy to overthrow the office of the President is being taken very seriously. She is said to be at the head of a select group of congressmen who have set in motion plans to use the president’s allegedly unlawful actions to begin imeachment hearings. Without evidence and with a clear denial from the president of these allegations such actions warrant charges of conspiracy and possibly even treason.

Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.

NBC News reports:

The two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday.

They will each be paid $1.

In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.

Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.

Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.

FDA Announced That Vaccines Are Causing Autism,http://inshapetoday.com/now-official-fda-announced-vaccines-causing-autism/,inshapetoday.com,1172,0,"According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.

These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.

Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

What’s in Tripedia?

According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.

What is the content of these two growth mediums?

Mueller and Miller medium contains:

Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.

While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:

Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.

The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.

“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.

With Election Day close and a Donald Trump presidency appearing increasingly likely, some of Hollywood's left-leaning stars are preparing to emigrate to the country up north if things go sour for them.

""Breaking Bad"" actor Bryan Cranston is the latest celebrity to suggest that he would leave the US for Canada in the event of a Trump victory in Tuesday's election.

He joins the likes of Barbara Streisand, Chelsea Handler, and several others who are planning to cross the border into the land of liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau should Hillary Clinton lose.

BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT”,http://www.patriotnetwork.one/2018/04/27/breaking-czech-republic-arms-citizens-you-can-now-shoot-terrorists-on-sight/,www.patriotnetwork.one,232,0,"WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving."
Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US,https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914/http://states-tv.com:80/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us,web.archive.org,61,0,"President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the country’s ban on the “peaceful activities” of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the country’s own constitution against them.

“You know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you” – Trump warned.

Trump went on to invite all Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.

“As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.” – Trump urged.

Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.

The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group’s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.

“The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia’s ministry of justice and deem the ‘Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia’ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,” said judge Yuri Ivanenko. “The property of the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue.”

A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents “pose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security”.

Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream Christianity’s core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world"
Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As “Experiment”,https://lidblog.com/illegal-immigrant-mexican-kids/,lidblog.com,32,0,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.

It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.

His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.

Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.

“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.

But the program was a surprise to Mexico

“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”

Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.

Below is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.

﻿

Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.

Student Hasn't Stopped Filming Since Florida School Shooting,http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/,time.com,43,0,"David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.

And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor—Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel—knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg—who’s an editor at the school’s TV station—found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.

The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.

“While I was in there, I thought, ‘What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?’” Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. “And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that’s all I could think: Get other people’s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that’s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.”

In the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It’s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it’s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.

“When do we say, that’s not acceptable, something has to change?” asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.

Hogg’s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.

RELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action

Will Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman’s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven’t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn’t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher’s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.

“It was hot in there. We were packed in tight,” he told TIME. “Some students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.” Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.

“My husband is ex-military, so it’s not like we’re anti-gun. But an AR-15?” Kristi Gilroy said. “You tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?” Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she’d taught when they were younger.

The usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. “Now, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,” Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. “Our students are asking for that.”

President Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.

“To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,” Trump said. “We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she’d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. “Having to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,” she said, her eyes full of tears.

To some, however, words of comfort won’t be enough. “When do we actually stand up? I think it’s the time that we all stand up,” Hogg demanded. “If you don’t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it’s going to be your child that’s next. And that’s horrifying.”

Meanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it’s okay to go back to school, that they’re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again."
McCain Blamed For Sabotaging Trump,https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836/http://thetrumpmedia.com:80/politics/mccain-blamed-sabotaging-trump,web.archive.org,61,0,"Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “unwavering support.”, reports Angry Patriot.

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.

The Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.

According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.

McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.

Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his “unwavering support” to the foreign leader.

Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call. Even if it had, that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do, which is protecting America.

New Law Makes it Illegal to Shower and Do Laundry on Same Day,https://web.archive.org/web/20180605205653/https://thefederalistpapers.org/us/new-law-illegal-to-shower-and-do-laundry-on-same-day,web.archive.org,61,0,"California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:

Assembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.

According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.

Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.

According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.

To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”

So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …

The new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.

This new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.

Even worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.

If the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.

Instead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.

Obama Goes To G20 Summit,https://web.archive.org/web/20170806200608/https://world-politicus.com/2017/07/08/obama-goes-g20-summit/,web.archive.org,46,0,"62.1k SHARES Share

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

CNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent,https://yournewswire.com/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent/,yournewswire.com,122,0,"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year

If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.

All of the discussion around Poole is fixated on his recent altercation with teammate Draymond Green, in which Green struck Poole in the face during a recent practise session.

The 23-year-old enjoyed a true breakout year last season, averaging 18.5 points per game — a total only bettered by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. In the Playoffs, Poole averaged 17 points per game and played a key role as the Warriors won their fourth NBA championship in eight years.

The impact Green’s unprovoked attack will have on the Warriors this year in their defense of the title remains to be seen. The power forward is currently away from the team after coming to a mutual agreement that he would stay away for the forseeable future.

Many NBA betting sites have the Warriors as the favourites to win the Western Conference and NBA Championship this season, but the dynamic could change following this recent scandal. Green is in the final year of his contract with the Warriors and is looking for the last big deal of his career; something the franchise may not be inclined to reward him with following this latest bout of indiscipline.

A trade could still be on the cards, but it appears that the Warriors are committed to building around Poole in the future. “There’s a reason he’s in this position, about to sign a big (contract) extension – hopefully,” said coach Steve Kerr after his first preseason appearance since the debacle. “The guy is tough. He’s mentally tough. He’s physically tough. He’s ultra-confident in his game, and he showed it tonight.”

One of the best betting sites, SportsBetting.ag, currently have Poole as the favorite to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award this season. Shooting guards have won this award in 16 of the last 18 seasons in the NBA, with bucket getters being the profile of player that the voters tend to go for.

The reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Tyler Herro, is a similar profile of player to Poole and both players are anticipated to sign comparible extensions with the franchises that drafted them in 2019. However, Herro has dropped to +1200 to retain his crown after he started during his only appearance in Miami’s preseason schedule.

Poole was ruled out of the running for Sixth Man of the Year last year after starting too many games to match the criteria due to Thompson’s injury. Now that one half of the splash brothers is back healthy, Poole should return to his place as the first man of the bench while Thompson and Andrew Wiggins occupy the wing positions.

Let’s also not forget narrative in all of this. Many NBA awards are won based on the narrative surrounding a player’s season, and as much as Poole wouldn’t have wanted this incident to happen, it will almost certainly lead to support in his corner.

United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/,now8news.com,23,0,"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”

After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.

The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements."
Hurricane Irene: ‘Photo’ of shark swimming in street is fake,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hurricane-irene-photo-of-shark-swimming-in-street-is-fake/2011/08/26/gIQABHAvfJ_blog.html,www.washingtonpost.com,134,0,"That’s because it is. Google ""shark,"" and up pops a great photo of a shark stalking a kayak from a 2005 issue of Africa Geographic.. Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark's belly.)

Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called ""Thank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street."" We've asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.

This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets. When the earthquake hit Japan, photographs of a damaged church started circulating. The church was located in Christchurch, New Zealand.

What's the lesson here? If you see a picture of a dolphin hanging out in Central Park after Irene moves through the East Coast this weekend, you may want to investigate it further."
